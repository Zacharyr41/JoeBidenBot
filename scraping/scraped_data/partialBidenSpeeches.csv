PRESIDENT BIDEN: When do you want to go?
Q: ""When you want to go""?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: When do you want to go?
Q: When do I want to go? I'll go with you, sir.
(President Ruto arrives.)
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Welcome.
PRESIDENT RUTO: Thank you very much, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.)
PRESIDENT RUTO: Thank you very much. Thank you for having us.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We're going to watch your car go by, and we're going to say -- say hello to the press.
PRESIDENT RUTO: Okay.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: We're heading today to Africa.
Q: You said what, sir?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: I'm joking. (Inaudible.) (Laughter.) Anyway --
Q: Do you think you'll get there before January?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: My -- I plan on going in February after I'm reelected.
PRESIDENT RUTO: You're welcome, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: You guys -- are these questions relevant? (Laughs.)"
1,"May 21, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)
Thank you, Governor Maura Healey. Thank you for that introduction, and thanks for your support. You've been a hell of a governor. (Laughter.)
You know, it wasn't a hard choice for me to make when we -- I came out and said I supported gay marriage. I remember when I was a kid and a good friend of mine, Paula Levine -- we go back a long way; knew my dad. I was being dropped off at the City Hall to get an application to be a lifeguard. I was a lifeguard at a -- at a country swimming club, and then I decided I wanted to work in the projects on the east side. And I got dropped off at the -- Rodney Square in the center of the city, where the DuPont company, Hercules company, and -- and DuPont company all kind of came together.
And I'm getting out of the car, and I looked over and two well-dressed men -- one who ended up walking to the Hercules building; the other walking to the DuPont building -- and they kissed each other. And I turned and looked at my dad. He looked back at me and said, ""Joey, it's simple. They love each other. It's simple."" That's what I think it's about.
Thank you all for your support. And, folks, I usually start my remarks with how the campaign is doing. You know, we've raised, with your help, over $400 million -- (applause) -- and we have nearly $200 million on hand. And we're building the strongest campaign in the history of America.
And that's all thanks to people like you in this room. But these are the days in a campaign when things happen that you just have to talk about. Today is one of those days.
Last night, Donald Trump posted on his official social media account a video talking about the America he would create if he wins. And it includes the following quote: ""a unified Reich"" -- ""a unified Reich,"" unquote. ""A unified Reich."" That's not the language of an American president. That's not the language of any American. That's the language of Hitler's Germany.
And talk about the day, but Trump finally took that video down today. He got some lame excuse that a staffer did it. But we already know Trump personally controls his social media account because he's bragged so much about control.
But it's not the first time Trump has gone down this road. He attacks his po- -- his opponents as ""vermin,"" end quote. He says immigrants are, quote, ""poisoning the blood"" of America. That's the language of Hitler's Germany, not an American president.
Folks, I can't be -- it can't be any clearer. The threat Trump poses is greater his second time around than it was the first. This is the same Trump who got elected in 2016, and something snapped when he lost in 2020.
He can't accept the fact he lost. It's literally driving him crazy. That's why January 6th happened. Every legal avenue Trump tried to change the election failed, so he unleashed the insurrection.
Now he's running again. He not only is obsessed with losing in 2020, he's clearly become unhinged. Just listen to him. He says he wants to be a dictator on ""day one."" He says he wants to ""terminate"" the Constitution. When asked if he thought violence would occur if he lost again, his comment was, ""It depends."" ""It depends.""
It depends? No American president ever said that until Trump came along. So, I'll say what he can't. There is no place for violence in American politics -- none, ever -- period. (Applause.)
He calls the insurrectionists who are in prison ""patriots."" And if reelected, he said he's going to pardon, quote, ""every one"" of them. Imagine had by -- imagine had those folks who went to the Capitol been Black, what he would have done. Imagine.
Pardon -- pardon them? These folks aren't patriots; they're criminals.
And, finally, Trump says if he loses again in November, there will be a, quote, ""bloodbath"" -- his phrase, not mine -- his phrase. A bloodbath? When do presidents talk like that in American history?
But it's not just a threat to our democracy that he poses; he's a threat to our personal freedoms as well. He's the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned.
Well, guess what? Elect Kamala and me, we're going to restore Roe v. Wade. (Applause.)
He's literally a threat to our health. He wants to get rid of $35 insulin that I was able to do and cap at $2,000 prescription drugs -- all drugs -- cumulatively for seniors. He still wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which -- and, by the way, it's the only reason why millions of people who have -- who have preexisting conditions will be able to get insurance at all.
He's a threat to the planet. Trump just told the big oil companies when he spoke to them that if they give him a million [billion] dollars, he'll give them whatever they want.
Folks, we're a long way from Trump telling us in 2016 how he didn't need anybody's money; he had plenty himself. He's so desperate, he's selling Bibles and golden sneakers now. (Laughter.) Can you imagine? Anyway. (Laughter.)
Folks, Trump isn't running to lead America. He's running for revenge. That's revenge. But revenge is no way to lead a country.
I'm running to lead a country into the bright and noble future, that we have enor- -- enormous opportunity in front of us if we grab it.
Look at the progress we've made so far: 15 million new jobs -- a record for any first term; unemployment under 4 percent for two years and going down; record business creation; record economic growth; record investments in taking on the climate crisis; billions of dollars in investment in making complex computer chips. They used to -- we invented, we improved, and we used to have 40 percent of the market. Used for everything from cell phones to automobiles to our weapons systems.
The single-greatest investment in rebuilding American infrastructure and roads in our history: bridges, roads, eliminating lead pipes, providing the Internet to all Americans -- affordable.
We have to do more, but inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent. And we're going to keep get- -- bringing it down and are going -- I -- you're going to see that get to 2 percent.
Let me close with this, because I don't want to keep you too long. Folks, we've made a lot of progress, but we've got to keep going.
That's why I need you. I know you can do this -- we can do this together. I've never been more optimistic about our future, and I mean that. I've been doing this a long time, but I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
We just have to grab hold of it. We have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity -- nothing. I mean it. (Applause.)
Folks, as a student of history, I can tell you we're the only nation in the world that has come through every crisis we've had stronger than we went into it. That's who we are. That's who we are.
We shouldn't stop now. There is so much opportunity, but we are on the cusp. We're at one of those inflection points in history. What happens in the next three, four years is going to determine what the four or five decades are going to look like. And we can make it look good.
And the rest of the world is looking to us. They really are. Madeleine talked about -- Mad- -- Madeleine Albright wrote about we're the essential nation. It's not hyperbole. Name me what country in the world could possibly lead the world without the United States. Name me one. Name me -- it's not possible.
So, we have an overwhelming obligation but an overwhelming opportunity.
You know, I'm a -- I'm a poet -- my colleagues, when I was in the Senate, used to always kid me I was always quoting Irish poets. They thought I did it because I was Irish. I did it because they're the best poets in the world. (Laughter and applause.)
But Seamus Heaney wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy."" And there's a stanza in that poem that I think we should pay attention to. It says, ""History teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave, but then once in a lifetime, that longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.""
I'm determined, with your help, to make hope and history rhyme again so the middle class, the working class have a chance and everybody does well.
Now, I'll stop and get to the real reason why we're here. (Laughter.) It's a real honor -- and I really mean it -- to welcome on stage a world-class musician, a friend, and someone who inspires me and people all over the world. Ladies and gentlemen, the real reason we're all here: Yo-Yo Ma.
Thank you. (Applause.)"
2,"May 21, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: If you have a seat, please take it. If you don't have a seat, I'll even be shorter than I was going to be. Please, sit down.
Mark and Audrey, thank you for the introduction and welcoming me here back to your home. I -- I appreciate it.
The first time, you may have been -- your fault. The second time, it's clearly your fault. (Laughter.) You know -- you should know better.
And, George and Douglas, thank you for co-hosting. I really mean it.
And, Governor Maura Healey, I don't know if she's here now still, but she met me at the airplane, and I want to thank her. She's doing a hell of a job.
And also, Michelle, thanks for the passport into town. I appreciate it. (Laughter.)
Thank you all for your support. I'm a Delaware guy, and -- but there's something special about this city. I mean, it really is. It's -- it's just a good feeling to be able to know you can be in Boston and Boston has your back. I really mean it.
I live- -- we lived in Newton for a while when I -- my dad was working in the shipyards during the war. But it's -- it's just a special place. It's like no other city in the world, in my view.
And we're -- we're rebuilding the strongest ground campaign in American history and really are. We're trying to get back to just basic block and tackle in campaigns.
So far, there's over 1.8 million people who've contributed to the -- this campaign. And the -- the 1.8 million people contributed under $200. People are doing it at 25, 50, 100 bucks. And it's -- and we've raised more money than anybody ever has at this point.
And so, in the battleground states, we've opened 150 -- 150 field offices. Trump hasn't opened a single one yet. We've organized -- we're organized, and we're ready.
You know, Trump and the MAGA Republicans are really in disarray right now. It's clear that when we [he] lost in 2020, something snapped in this guy. And when he lo- -- I mean, really, there's something different. He just can't accept the fact he lost. It's just beyond his capacity.
And that's why January 6th happened, in my view. That's why January 6th happened. Every legal avenue Trump tried to change the election failed and unleashed that -- that insurrection.
He's now running again. And the threat that Trump poses is greater in a second term than it was in his first. And, again, that's not hyperbole.
He's only obsessed with one thing -- about losing in 2020. And it's clearly unhinged him. And I -- I mean it. I -- the guy is a little unhinged right now.
And he did a long interview with TIME Magazine this week. You ought to -- if you haven't seen it, get it. Read it. He just straightforward want -- saying what he wants to do. He says, ""A lot of people -- a lot of people liked the fact that I said I'd be dictator on day one"" -- ""a lot of people.""
He -- asked if he thought violence could occur if he lost, and he said, ""It depends.""
He called the insurrectionists in prison ""patriots."" He says he's going to release them if he wins -- ""every one"" of them.
And yesterday, his campaign posted online about -- he wants to -- if he wins, there'll be a ""unified Reich,"" like the Third Reich. This is the same guy -- this is Hitler's language, not America's. It's no surprise that when he -- about four months ago, he talked about -- I think maybe a little longer -- that Hitler did ""some"" -- quote, ""some good things."" He did ""some good things.""
Trump says if loses again in November, that there will be a ""bloodbath"" -- a bloodbath in America. I mean, the guy means what he says.
He's not accepting the results of the election when -- if he loses again, he pointed out.
And it's clear that all those -- all those people auditioning to be his vice president, they're all singing the same -- trying to pass the same litmus test. They've all said the election -- even the ones who said that he lost are now saying, ""No, no, he won. Biden stole the election."" And if he loses the election, they're all saying they will not accept the results either.
This has not happened in American history. This has not happened.
Look what he's saying about reproductive freedom. He's bragging that he's the reason Roe v. Wo- -- Wade was overturned. And it was, because of the appointments he made to the bench.
But, you know, loo- -- look at the piece in TIME Magazine. He said states should monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate the bans. Monitor women's pregnancies. I mean, you know, prosecute them.
You know, folks, Trump isn't running to lead America. He is running on revenge, and he really is. That's revenge. Revenge but -- in no way -- is no way to lead the country. That's how he wants to do it.
He's running to lead America into the future. That's what he says he's going to do, but he doesn't want to do that.
Look, I mean, I don't have time and I don't want to keep you standing, but just read what he's saying.
Look, we made some real progress. We got a way to go.
We've created 15 million new jobs -- 15 million new jobs -- more than anybody has in one term. People have more health insurance than they ever did before -- our history, and we still cut the deficit.
And it took Big Pharma, won to lower price prescriptions -- for prescription drugs. All the people of -- who need insulin. You -- all of you know somebody who needs insulin for diabetes. Well, guess what? It was costing $400 a month or more. It's now -- can't charge more than 35 bucks a month. Because, by the way, it costs -- it costs $10 to make it.
Our reforms not only save lives, but it's saving taxpayers billions of dollars. That one thing of reducing the -- the last change we made in terms of Medicare, that's reduced the federal debt by $160 billion -- $160 billion because they don't have to pay the exorbitant prices anymore.
And, look, I'm proud that the new report released by 20 major climate organizations -- from the Sierra Club to the Sunrise Movement -- cited my administration for taking more than 300 actions related to climate, conservation, public health, and clean energy.
And Boston is a national leader, including the New England Aquarium, which is focused on coastal erosion and so much more.
And I'm proud to have restored protections for the Northeast Canyons and the Se- -- the Seamounts in the natural -- as national mon- -- monuments. It's a big deal. It's going to be here for a long time.
And we've also put more land in conservation than any -- somebody -- since John Kennedy. And we're going to put 30 percent of all the land and seas in conservation by the year 2030.
Meanwhile, Trump is determined to get rid of the climate law -- I mean, he's being straightforward about it -- I mean, he flat out wants to get rid of it -- get rid of it, because the oil companies hate it.
In fact, it has been reported that he asked Big Oil to direct $1 billion toward his campaign and said if they did that, there'd be ""a deal."" ""We'd have a deal.""
What's the deal? They want to -- they -- Big -- Big Oil -- it's not about getting lower prices for -- he wants Big Oil to fund his campaign in exchange -- in exchange for a repeal of everything we've done on climate. That's what he said in TIME Magazine. Just look at it. It's on the front -- there was a front cover of him last -- I guess it's this past month. And he -- and he just says one thing. He wants to drill, drill, drill.
This is the same guy that told you if you had windmills off your coast, it was going to cause cancer. And we're going -- I mean it's just -- it's -- it almost is hard to believe what he says.
And the threat just isn't Trump; it's his MAGA Republican Congress. The House of Representatives put together a plan, and I -- I just -- I wasn't going to take the time, but I think I should. The Congressional Budget Office analysis, which is a bipartisan operation -- it's not Democrat or Republican -- did an analysis of his -- of the budget that the House Republicans put out. Okay?
It cuts Social Security by $1.5 trillion. Raise your retirement age by two years. Raise Medicare costs by repealing the ability to negotiate drug prices, the caps on insulin, and a $2,000 out-of-poc- -- package limitation for seniors. Turn Medicare into a premium support voucher-style program that raises premiums for all seniors. Repeal the Affordable Care Act protections against denying care for people with preexisting conditions. There's over 20 million people who have preexisting con- -- that wouldn't be able to get insurance without the existence of that act.
He also says he wants -- they're saving -- they're going to use savings for a $5.5 trillion tax cut and repeal the minimum tax on corporations and real estate.
Look, I come from the corporate st- -- state of the world. More -- more folks are -- more corporations are incorporated in my state than every other state in the Union combined. I represented the state for over 36 years in the Senate. I'm not anti-corporation, but there's got to be some balance -- what we're talking about -- just some balance.
And he says that the national abortion ban, they en- -- this is the House -- endorsed life as a -- at moment of conception -- no rape, no incest exceptions, and no bans -- and he wants to ban even -- they're talking about banning certain contraceptions.
He defunds the Community Oriented Policing Services -- the COPS Program -- that support local law enforcement in 500 towns and cities all across America.
I could go on. They're just saying it out loud what they're going to do.
Folks, we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, protecting freedoms. We have to keep that going because all -- it's all at stake.
Look, let me close with this. Our freedoms -- in my view, our freedoms and our democracy are literally at stake. I know that sounds like hyperbole.
Some of you may remember, when I ran the first time -- and you helped me the very first time, a lot of you in this room, but my -- this household -- that, in fact, if -- we talked about how he was going to do a number of things that were contrary to everything we thought would happen.
And -- and I made a speech shortly before the election -- made a speech -- and after the election as well -- on the threat to democracy. And I did it at -- at Constitution [Independence] Hall. And I -- at, you know, where they wrote the Declaration -- I mean, excuse me, where they wrote the Constitution.
And I laid it out. And the press -- there are a lot of good press here, and I'm not being critical. But they wondered why I was focused on that, because I said democracy was at stake.
Well, guess what? 63 percent of the American people in the polls said they thought it was too, because of the things that are happening.
That's why I need you. I need you, I need you, because I know we can do this together. I've never been more optimistic about our future. We just have to remember who in the hell we are.
In 2020, I wasn't going to run again because I had just lost my -- not just -- I had lost my son on Memorial Day in 2015. He was in Iraq, and he was near one of those burn pits for a year, and he came home with stage four glioblastoma and died.
And I wasn't going to run again until -- remember what happened when -- down in Charlottesville, Virginia, when that group came out of the woods carrying torches, chanting the same antisemitic bile -- the same exact bile -- that was chanted in Germany in the early '30s, carrying swastikas -- not -- not a joke -- carrying swastikas, and saying what they wanted to do? And a young woman was killed, and I ended up talking to her mother. And th- -- accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.
And -- and sh- -- and afterwards, the press went to her -- him and said -- to Trump and said, ""What -- what's your view of all this?"" He said there were very good people on both sides -- very good people on both sides.
That's not who in the hell we are, guys. That's not who we are. But if we don't watch it -- if we don't watch it -- and I know I'm responsible to make sure not to let you down, but we have to win. And you're all putting me in a position to be able to compete and win. And I hope I don't screw it up for you. Because if I do, it's --
And, by the way, the national press is here. I -- I'm going to say it again. I go to -- I've been deeply involved in foreign policy my whole career -- chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; I know all the heads of state before, and I know them now. Barack asked me to be vice president in large part because of my foreign policy background.
And I go to these international meetings of heads of state -- the G7, the G20, all -- and I give you my word: Every one of those meetings, and I've attended a number of them since I've become president, somebody will grab you -- another president or another prime minister or head of state will grab my arm as I'm walking out, pull me aside, and say, ""You can't let him win. You can't let him win."" And then they look at me and say, ""Because m-"" -- meaning their -- ""my democracy is at stake.""
Folks, there's a lot at stake. We talk about -- it's not an important election because I'm running. That's not the reason why it's important. This is one of the most important elections of our life.
I've said to other people that, you know, when I run, I always want to win. Everybody wants -- I'm a competitor. But this isn't about my winning. It's about making sure he doesn't win.
You're putting me in a position to be competitive enough to make sure that he doesn't. So, thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, you know, as I said, this is the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. We're the only nation in the world -- the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. Think about it, as a student of history. Every crisis we face, we come out stronger than we went in.
And the world is looking to us. They really are. Whether it's in Israel or Gaza, whether it's in Ukraine, where- -- where it is. They're tough decisions, but we can make them. And we have to stick together.
Thanks for putting me in the position to compete. (Applause.)"
3,"May 21, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Let me push this in. I pushed in the stand.
Hey, guys. How you doing? Good to see you. Hope Mommy and Daddy are promising you a real gift for doing this. (Laughter.)
Folks, I want to say -- Sergeant, I want to thank you for your service and for the introduction of me. I appreciate it very much. And congratulations on your promotion. And I know your whole family is so proud.
You know, when my son Beau was promoted to a major in Iraq, I happened to be there shortly afterwards. And I said, ""Now you're a field grade officer."" He said, ""I have no illusions, Dad, who runs the Army: those folks with stripes on their shoulders."" And you do. I want thank you.
Look, I want to thank Senator Maggie Hassan, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, and Annie -- Congresswoman Annie Kuster for their work on behalf of veterans.
And former Governor John Lynch is here with his Dr. Su- -- his wife, Dr. Susan, who -- their friendship for years has meant a great deal to me and to my family.
And, Secretary McDonough, thank you for your leadership, because it really matters.
To all the veterans and families that are here today, I want to say thank you. We could never fully thank you for all the sacrifices you've made. Only 1 percent of the American population has risked everything to defend our other 99 percent of us. One percent, that's it. We owe you. We owe you big.
I've long said -- (inaudible) got in trouble for saying it, that -- about 30 years ago -- that America has a lot of obligations, but only one truly sacred obligation -- sacred obligation. And that's to prepare those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they come home and if they don't come home, care for their families.
Nearly two years ago, we took a giant step toward fulfilling that obligation when I fought for and signed the PACT Act. It was one of the most significant laws ever. It surprised me anybody voted against it, but a bunch did. We set up to help millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during their services.
And today, I'm proud to announce the VA just granted its one-millionth -- one-millionth PACT Act claim. One million. (Applause.) A major milestone, providing $5.7 million [billion] in benefits to 890,000 veterans and their families so far in hand, including 3,000 here in New Hampshire.
It matters, because too many service members have not only braved the battlefields, but they also -- while breathing in toxic fumes and burn -- from burn pits and other means. You know, pits as big as a football field -- 100 yards long, 10 feet deep -- that incinerate all the wastes of war, everything from tires to chemicals and jet fuel and so much more -- so much more. Smoke thick with poison spreading through the air, into the lungs of many thousands of troops who lived and worked near them -- in one of those burn pits.
I know. I saw them in Iraq and Afghanistan. In my many times in and out, you could smell it in the air.
And when our troops came home, many of the fittest, best-trained warriors we've ever seen -- we saw, like in 9/11 fighters -- firefighters, they were incredibly helpful in my -- making my case. Because what happened? Look at all those firefighters that died of cancer as a consequence of being exposed to those toxic fumes. Headaches, numbness, dizziness, trouble breathing, cancer, brain cancer.
Folks, you've suffered long enough. You shouldn't have to prove that your illness came from the service. But thanks to the PACT Act, you don't have to prove it now.
My son Beau was one of those veterans. So, this is personal to me and my family and to his family and his children so -- and so many of yours. So, I took office; I -- I determined that, come hell or high water, we were going to protect the heroes who protect our nation.
We learned a terrible lesson after Vietnam as those harmful effects of Agent Orange took years to manifest and left too many veterans without the care they deserved, because they had to prove that every ill- -- illness they had was a consequence of Agent Orange, which was often too hard to do.
That's why I cosponsored the Agent Oran Act [sic] -- Agent Orange Act as a senator way back in 1991: to support veterans exposed to toxic substances in Vietnam. That's why I pushed to pass the PACT Act so today's veterans don't suffer the same painful, frustrating delays and denials. That's why we continue to work around the clock to get veterans benefits they deserve and get them now.
Many of you and your family members and advocates fought for years to make this happen. Folks literally slept on the Capitol steps the week we were fighting this out the -- in -- in the Senate to get it done. They literally slept on the steps.
After 41 Republican senators -- the vast majority of that caucus -- voted against the bill, against expanding healthcare for disabled veterans, New Hampshire's congre- -- congressional leaders worked hard to help push it through. And they all -- the senators and congresswoman stepped up.
Since then, we've launched the biggest outreach campaign in VA history to make sure veterans in every -- every state, territory, and area know what the law does.
First, it expands eligibility for VA healthcare. Today, toxic-exposed veterans who served during any con- -- any conflict, not just the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, can enroll. Over 145,000 veterans are now getting care as a result of that one change. The law also provides regular toxic-exposure screenings to catch problems early when they can be dealt with.
It expands access to disability benefits, including monthly payments for folks who have fallen sick. And we've made those benefits effective immediately -- no wait, immediately.
The law is i- -- look, the bottom line is people not being sure we'd get it done without a lot of complication.
The law invests in new facilities, new research, more healthcare workers at VA hospitals. And I'm committed to making the long-needed upgrades in the facilities -- the VA's facilities right here in New Hampshire.
For families who have lost a loved one, the PACT Act means monthly stipends of about $3,000 a month for a surviving spouse with two -- with two children. And, by the way, the surviving spouse gets those benefits for the rest of their lives. It means tuition benefits for children to go to college, to get job training.
I'll never make up for the lost -- you lost a piece of your soul: a husband, wife, son, daughter. But we owe it to folks, all of th- -- everyone -- everyone we can to help put their lives back together, because it's tough stuff.
In America, we leave no veteran behind. That's the motto.
On my way here today, I met veterans named Lisa Clark over at the VFW. She served in the Air Force, where she met her husband, a combat engineer who served in Vietnam. They were together 42 years. He was exposed to Agent Orange during his time in Vietnam. And last year, he passed away from cancer.
Thanks to the PACT Act, the burden was not on Lisa to prove the Agent Orange caused his cancer. And thanks to that, the PACT Act, Lisa now receives $1,600 a month in survivor benefits. It doesn't take away the pain of losing her husband, but it allowed her to keep living in the same home they shared for 20 years.
Service is a tradition in Lisa's family and so many of your families that are in this room today. Her dad, Anthony, joined the Navy when he was 18 years old, served in World War Two. He's now 96 years old, and I think he's here in the room today. Where are you, Dad? (Applause.) Thank you.
Like my deceased father-in-law, as we say in the Catholic church, ""No purgatory for this guy."" Five daughters. (Laughter.) Straight to Heaven.
And, by the way, I say to every young man thinking of getting married: Marry into a family of five or more daughters. I did. My wife is the oldest of five sisters. You know why? One of them will always love you. (Laughter.) Not the same one. One of them is always -- be on your side. That's the biggest advantage of marrying into five daughters.
Lisa's brother-in-law and nephew also served in Iraq and Afghanistan. They were exposed to toxic burn kits [pits]. Because they're both fighting lung -- now, because of that, they're fighting lung and heart disease. But the PACT Act is finally getting them the VA benefits they deserve.
Lisa has called it a ""game changer,"" and says vet- --volunteer- -- and she volunteers at the VA in Manchester to, quote, as she says, ""to give something back."" She's already given a lot.
Lisa, you spent years giving back. It's time we have your back and have it now. (Applause.)
And, by the way, that's literally what the PACT Act does.
I'm asking everyone to help spread the word. As a -- go to VA.gov/PACT -- P-A-C-T -- and apply for VA healthcare, get screened for toxic exposure, and file a claim. Or go to your VA or veterans' organization for help. They have staff from the VA here today to help sign you up if you need that help.
Folks, in the last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more overall claims than ever in the entire history of the VA.
And since I took office, we have passed over 30 bipartisan laws supporting veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors. We've increased resources to end veteran homelessness; hired and trained hundreds of additional mental health providers, specifically to help veterans end the silent scourge of veteran suicide; and -- while recruiting veterans to help other veterans to understand what's going on and what they're going through.
Asking for help is a sign of strength. And reaching out to your fellow vets to saves lives -- it's not a weakness.
We're also working to protect veterans from scammers who target their benefits. No one should be defrauded in a nation they defended.
You know, and through my wife Jill's work in Joining Forces, we've taken the most comprehensive actions in history to expand economic opportunity for military spouses and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors. That means jobs, trainings, childcare, eldercare, and more.
Today veterans unemployment rate is near a record low of 3.2 percent as a consequence of all this. We have a lot more to do, but our plan is working.
Let me close with this. After I signed the PACT into -- PACT A- -- lac- -- Act into law, I handed the pen that I signed it with -- which is a tradition to the most -- person most responsible for the legislation -- to a widow and her daughter of the late Sergeant First Class Heath Robertson [Robinson]. They fought for years to see it passed. And the -- finally, the family that suffered the greatest loss turned its pain into purpose to help others.
That's courage. That's character. That's America. We came together to keep our promises.
Veterans, you are the solid steel spine of our nation, and that's not hyperbole. Your families are the courageous heart. Generations of patriots have stood on the frontlines of freedom, each one a -- each one a link in a chain of honor stretching back to our founding days.
Just as you have done your duty to America in the past, you're doing it -- they're -- we're now, finally, beginning to do our duty to you.
The United States of America -- that's who we are, and there's nothing -- nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. We got to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. Nothing is beyond our capacity.
May God bless our veterans. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you very much. (Applause.)"
4,"May 20, 2024","THE SECOND GENTLEMAN: I got to wait for that song to end. (Laughter.)
Good evening.
AUDIENCE: Good evening.
THE SECOND GENTLEMAN: It is my honor to be standing here with President Biden and Vice President Harris. (Applause.) They have both stood strong with the Jewish community time and time again. There is no one fighting harder to combat hate and to unite our country.
To all of our esteemed guests, it is so great to join you for a Jewish American Heritage Month celebration at the White House. (Applause.)
Tonight, we've come together to celebrate our heritage and honor our culture, to reflect on the invaluable contributions of our ancestors and the Jewish leaders of today.
But it is also a challenging time for our community. It's been a dark and difficult seven months. I know a lot of us are feeling alone, afraid, and in pain.
There is an epidemic of hate, including a crisis of antisemitism, in our country and around the world. We see it on our streets, our college campuses, and our places of worship.
I know it's difficult to have hope and to feel optimistic right now. And to be honest, some days, it's really challenging for me to put myself out here and do this work publicly. And I know it's hard for you too. But we keep fighting because we have no choice but to fight. (Applause.)
Jewish leaders are on the frontlines fighting antisemitism through education, advocacy, and building bridges with other communities. It's because of your leadership that we will dismantle prejudice and ensure Jewish safety. (Applause.)
I also want to acknowledge the student leaders who are here with us today. (Applause.) You have stood up to hate and antisemitism on college campuses. And on behalf of our nation, thank you for your courage. And let me be clear: We have your back. (Applause.)
Ever since that horrific day of October 7th, I've been reaching out to Jewish leaders and Jewish students all across the country just to check in and see how they're feeling. And in each of these conversations, my message is always the same: We still need to find and embrace that Jewish joy.
Joy is what I remember most about growing up Jewish. And it's what I felt in some of my favorite moments as Second Gentleman, like returning to my Jewish summer camp and reliving the memory of being voted ""Most Athletic."" (Laughter.) Or when I attended -- (laughter) --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) You did. (Laughter.)
THE SECOND GENTLEMAN: (Laughs.) Or --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're still athletic! (Laughter.)
THE SECOND GENTLEMAN: Or -- thank you.
Or when I attended the BBYO International Convention and spoke with -- (applause) -- there you go -- with the next generation of leaders about how proud they are of being Jewish.
And when the Vice President, my wife, and I affixed the first-ever mezuzah on the door of the Vice President's Residence with our entire family there. (Applause.) And honestly, I think it's one of the only times I've ever seen my father cry was during that moment.
So, it's that same feeling of joy I want everyone to experience, especially our young people, because we cannot live in fear. We cannot be afraid. We must always raise our voices and live openly and proudly as Jews. (Applause.)
Last year, before my trip to Poland and Germany to recognize International Holocaust Remembrance Day, President Biden pulled me into the Oval Office. He shared with me his memories of visiting the Dachau concentration camp with his children and grandchildren -- and also how angry his father was that the Allies had not bombed the train tracks leading to the concentration camps.
Then, in the immediate aftermath of October 7th, I stood beside President Biden as he condemned the pure evil Hamas unleashed into the world and staunchly proclaimed his support for the Jewish people and Israel. (Applause.)
He reaffirmed America's ironclad commitment to Israel's security, and that hasn't changed. President Biden and Vice President Harris are steadfast in their support of Israel and the entire Jewish community. (Applause.) Thank you.
I am so grateful for their leadership, especially during these challenging times.
So, please join me in welcoming President Joe Biden. (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Kamala and Doug. It's an almost -- it's an honor to be introduced by the first-ever Jewish spouse of an American President -- Vice President.
It's also -- have with us the Attorney General, members of Congress, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who will be here soon; Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is responsible for this occurring -- having sponsored this early on -- (applause) -- back when she was 12 years old as a c- --
And to all of you here, welcome to the White House to celebrate extraordinary contributions of Jewish Americans in the nation. Look, the story of the Jewish people is a story of resilience -- absolute resilience from pain and persecution, to hope and delight even in the darkest times.
The story that endures. Throughout our history, Jewish people helped define and expand the singular idea that binds us together as Americans -- this is not hyperbole: freedom. Freedom -- the bedrock principle on which this nation was built and that American Jews fought for since the 1600s after fleeing persecution abroad.
One of our nation's first commitments to freedom of religion was in the Jewish community in Newport, Rhode Island. It goes back a long way. 1790, America was just 14 years old. A local Jewish leader wrote a letter to President George Washington expressing his hope that America would be a nation of religious freedom not just for Jews but for all citizens -- a nation which, quote, ""gives bigotry no sanction [and] persecution no assistance.""
It helped bring -- lay the groundwork for religious freedom and the First Amendment in our com- -- amendment in our Constitution.
And ever since, Jews have been in the forefront of helping realize the promise of America for all Americans. Jewish artists, poets helped define the American vision of liberty for millions of people who come to our shores.
And, look, Jewish suffragettes and advocates have fought for women's rights, voting rights every -- every right we have.
My whole career, every -- every fight to increase civil rights and civil liberties have been led by Jewish community, where I come from. The Jewish faith leaders and citizens march, petition, boarded a bus, demanded civil rights for all.
Jewish scientists and engineers and doctors have led breakthroughs in innovation, technology, and medicine.
Across government, Jewish Americans have proudly served our nation in uniform and elected appointive office in embassies and civil service and our nation's highest courts.
That's why Jill and I hosted the first-ever High Holiday reception at the White House. The -- (applause) -- it's important. The first-ever permanent White House (inaudible), made from the original wood of the White House building -- (applause) -- to make clear that the history and vibrancy of the Jewish life is woven into the very fabric of America, and it's permanent. It's permanent.
But, look, I know today's reception falls on hard times. The trauma of October 7th and its aftermath of the deadliest day the Jewish people have undergone since the Holocaust is still fresh and ongoing and many of -- with many of you.
And we have parents of someone being held hostage right now. And we're -- we're going to get him home. We're going to get him home come hell or high water. (Applause.)
Twelve hundred innocent (inaudible) slaughtered in their kibbutz; massacred at a -- a music festival; brutally raped, mutilated, sexually assaulted. Hundreds taken hostage and thousands more wounded, carrying the scars and the memory of what they endured. You all know someone, directly or indirectly -- family, friends -- who were stolen from you or are in a harm's way now.
And my commitment to the safety the Jewish people, the security of Israel and its right to exist is -- as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. (Applause.) No, it really is.
My administration is working around the clock to free the remaining hostages, just as we have freed hostages already.
And here with us today is Hersh Gold- -- Goldberg-Polin, and who is still -- he -- he is not here with us, but he's still being held by Hamas, and Rachel and Jon are here with us. Stand up, guys. (Applause.) Their love, strength, and compassion inspire the entire world. And I pledge to both of you -- and I mean it -- and I know you know, Mom, that I mean it -- that I will not rest until we bring your loved one home. We got to bring him home. (Applause.)
And, folks, let me [be] clear. I'll always ensure that Israel has everything it needs to defend itself against Hamas and all other enemies, just as I did when Iran's unprecedented attack last month. (Applause.)
We stand with Israel to take out Sinwar and the rest of the butchers of Hamas. (Applause.) We want Hamas defeated. We'll work with Israel to make that happen.
And consistent with Jewish values in compassion, kindness, and dignity and human life, my team also is providing critical humanitarian assistance to help innocent Palestinian civilians who are suffering greatly because of the war Hamas -- Hamas has unleashed. (Applause.) It's heartbreaking.
As we do this, we're also committed to bring the region together to work toward a two-state solution that provides security, prosperity, and enduring peace for Israel and Palestinians. (Applause.)
And let me be clear: We reject the ICC's application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. (Applause.) Whatever these warrants may imply, there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas. (Applause.) And it's clear Israel wants all -- do all it can to ensure civilian protection.
But let me be clear. Contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what's happening is not genocide. We reject that. (Applause.) And we'll always stand with Israel and it's -- in the threats against its security.
Compounding the pain and [is] a vicious surge of antisemitism around the world, here in America as well, in our streets, our social media, and college campuses. It's amazing it's happening. It's absolutely despicable. It's wrong, and it must stop. It must stop.
In America, we respect and protect fundamental rights of free speech to protest peacefully. That's America. But there's no place in any campus in America, any place in America for antisemitism, for hate speech that threatens violence of any kind against Jews or anyone else. (Applause.)
Nobody should fear going to synagogue or school or walking on the street wearing a symbol of your faith. That's wrong -- simply wrong.
And that's why, long before October 7th, I launched the nation's first National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. (Applause.) And it's mobilizing the full force of the federal government to crack down on antisemitism wherever we find it.
We recently cured -- secured an additional $400 million, the largest increase ever, in physical security for nonprofits, including synagogues, Jewish community centers, Jewish schools, Jewish nonprofits.
My Department of Education has put colleges on notice that antidesem- -- antisemitism is discrimination prohibited under Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act, period. And the Department has to investigate discriminatively and aggressively -- discrimination aggressively.
That's my Special Envoy to Monitor and (inaudible) Antisemitism, Deborah -- Deborah, you all -- where -- where -- is Deborah here?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: Deborah, thank you -- Lipstadt -- for furthering our efforts all around the world. It matters. This matters.
To the Jewish community, I want you to know: I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. And let me assure you, as your President: You are not alone. You belong. You always will belong. (Applause.)
Let me close it this. In moments like this, we do well to remember that this ancient story of Jewish resilience endures because of its people. That's what today is all about: feeling the joy and pride of community; honoring the beauty of your unshakeable faith; and celebrating heritage and legacy of Jewish Americans, who continue to enrich every single part of our life.
So, thank you for what you've done for America and for the whole world to make it a better place.
May the Jewish people shine their light and shine the light of the -- on the world for generations to come, because we need you badly.
So, God bless you all. And God protect our troops. Thank you for being here. (Applause.)"
5,"May 19, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.)
Thank you, thank you, thank you, President Thomas, faculty, staff, alumni. And a special thanks -- I'll ask all the folks who helped you get here -- your mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers -- all those who got you here, all the way in the back, please, parents, grandparents, all who helped, stand up, because we owe you a debt of gratitude. (Applause.) To all the family.
And that is not hyperbole. A lot of you, like my family, had to make significant sacrifices to get your kids to school. It mattered. This mattered a lot.
And the friends of Morehouse and the Morehouse men of the Class of 2024.
I got more Morehouse men in the White House telling me what to do than I know what to do. (Laughter.) You all think I'm kidding, don't you? (Laughs.) You know I'm not. And it's the best thing that's happened to me.
Scripture says, ""The prayers of a righteous man availeth much."" In Augusta, Georgia, a righteous man once enslaved set foot for freedom. The story goes he feared no evil; he walked through the valley of the shadow of death on his way north to free soil in Philadelphia. A Baptist minister, he walked with faith in his soul, powering the steps of his feet to glory.
But after the Union won the war, he knew his prayers availed him freedom that was not his alone. And so, this righteous man, Richard Coulter, returned home, his feet wary, his spirit in no ways tired.
A hundred and fifty-seven years ago -- you all know the story, but the rest of the world doesn't, and it should -- in the basement of a Baptist church in Augusta, he and two other ministers, William Jefferson White and Edmund Turney, planted the seeds of something revolutionary -- and it was at the time -- a school -- a school to help formerly enslaved men enter the ministry, where education would be the great equalizer from slavery to freedom -- an institution of higher learning that would become Morehouse College.
I don't know any other college in America that has that tradition and that consequence.
To the Class of 2024, you join, as you know, a sacred tradition. An education makes you free. And Morehouse education makes you fearless. (Applause.) I mean it. Visionary. Exceptional.
Congratulations. You are Morehouse men. God love you. (Applause.)
And, again, I thank your families and your friends who helped you get here, because they made sacrifices for you as well.
This graduation day is a day for generations, a day of joy, a day earned, not given.
We gather on this Sunday morning because -- if we were in church, perhaps there would be this reflection. There would be a reflection about resurrection and redemption. Remember, Jesus was buried on Friday, and it was Sunday -- on Sunday he rose again. But -- but we don't talk enough about Saturday, when the discip- -- his disciples felt all hope was lost.
In our lives and the lives of the nation, we have those Saturdays -- to bear witness the day before glory, seeing people's pain and not looking away. But what work is done on Saturday to move pain to purpose? How can faith get a man, get a nation through what was to come?
Here's what my faith has taught me.
I was the first Biden to ever graduate from college, taking out loans with my dad and my -- all through school to get me there. My junior year spring break, I fell in love at first sight, literally, with a woman I adored. I graduated from law school in her hometown, and I got married and took a job at a law firm in my hometown, Wilmington, Delaware. But then everything changed.
One of my heroes -- and he was my hero -- a Baptist minister, a Morehouse man, Dr. Martin Luther King -- in April of my law school graduation year, he was murdered.
My city of Wilmington -- and we were a -- to our great shame, a slave state, and we were segregated. Delaware erupted into flames when he was assassinated, literally.
We're the only city in America where the National Guard patrolled every street corner for nine full months with drawn bayonets, the longest stretch in any American city since the Civil War.
Dr. le- -- Dr. King's legacy had a profound impact on me and my generation, whether you're Black or white. I left the fancy law firm I had just joined and decided to become a public defender and then a county councilman, working to change our state's politics to embrace the cause of civil rights.
The Democratic Party in Delaware was a Southern Democratic Party at the time. We wanted to change it to become a Northeastern Democratic Party.
Then, we were trying to get someone to run for the United States Senate the year Nixon ran. I was 29 years of age. I had no notion of running -- I love reading about everybody knew I was going to run; I didn't know I was going to run -- (laughter) -- when a group of senior members of the Democratic Party came to me. They couldn't find anybody to run and said, ""You should run.""
Nixon won my state by 60 percent of the vote. We won by 3,100 votes. We won by the thinnest of margins but with a broad coalition, including students from the best HBCU in America, Delaware State University. You guys are good, but -- (laughter) -- they got me elected. And you all -- you all think I'm kidding. (Laughter.) I'm not kidding.
But by Christmas, I was a newly elected senator hiring staff in Washington, D.C., when I got a call from the first responders, my fire department in my hometown, that forever altered my life. They put a young woman first responder on the line to say, ""There was an automobile accident. A tractor-trailer hit your wife's car while she was Christmas shopping with your three children."" And she -- poor woman, she just blurted out. She said, ""Your wife and daughter are killed"" -- my 13-month-old daughter -- ""they're dead, and your almost three-year-old and four-year-old sons are badly injured. We're not sure they're going to make it, either.""
I rushed from Washington to their bedside. I wanted to pray, but I was so angry. I was angry at God. I was angry at the world.
I had the same pain 43 years later when that four-year-old boy who survived was a grown man and a father himself, laying in another hospital bed at Walter Reed hospital having contracted stage four glioblastoma because he was a year in Iraq as a major -- he won the Bronze Star -- living next to a burn pit. Cancer took his last breath.
On this walk of life, you can understand -- you come to understand that we don't know where or what fate will bring you or when. But we also know we don't walk alone. When you've been a beneficiary of the compassion of your family, your friends, even strangers, you know how much the compassion matters.
I've learned there is no easy optimism, but by faith -- by faith, we can find redemption.
I was a single father for five years --
No man deserves one great love, let alone two. My youngest brother, who was a hell of an athlete, did a great thing. He introduced me to a classmate of his and said, ""You'll love her; she doesn't like politics."" (Laughter.)
But all kidding aside, until I met Jill, who healed -- who healed the family in all the broken places. Our family became my redemption.
Many of you have gone through similar or worse -- and even worse things. But you lean on others, they lean on you, and together, you keep the faith in a better day tomorrow. But it's not easy.
I know four years ago, as some of your speakers have already mentioned, it felt like one of those Saturdays.
The pandemic robbed you of so much. Some of you lost loved ones -- mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, who were -- aren't able to be here to celebrate with you today -- today. You missed your high school graduation. You started college just as George Floyd was murdered and there was a reckoning on race.
It's natural to wonder if democracy you hear about actually works for you.
What is democracy if Black men are being killed in the street?
What is democracy if a trail of broken promises still leave Black -- Black communities behind?
What is democracy if you have to be 10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot?
And most of all, what does it mean, as we've heard before, to be a Black man who loves his country even if it doesn't love him back in equal measure? (Applause.)
When I sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, in front of the fireplace across from my -- my desk, I have two busts: one of Dr. King and one of Bobby Kennedy. I often find myself looking at those busts and making decisions. I ask myself: Are we living up to what we say we are as a nation, to end racism and poverty, to deliver jobs and justice, to restore our leadership in the world?
Then I look down and see the rosary on my wrist that was out of -- my late son, he had on him when he w- -- died at Walter Reed and I was with him. And I ask myself: What would he say? I know the answer because he told me in his last days.
My son knew the days were numbered. The last conversation was, ""Dad, I'm not afraid, but I'm worried. I'm worried you're going to give up when I go. You're going to give up.""
We have an expression in the Biden family. When you want someone to know -- give you their word, you say, ""Look at me."" He was lying to me -- he said, ""Look at me, Dad. Look at me.""
He said, ""Give me your word. Give me your word as my father that you will not quit, that you will stay engaged. Promise me, Dad. Stay engaged. Promise me. Promise me.""
I wrote a book called ""Promise Me, Dad,"" not for the public at large, although a lot of people would end up buying it. It's for my grandchildren and great-grandchildren to know who Beau Biden was.
The rosary on the -- my wrist, the bust in my office remind me that faith asks you to hold on to hope, to move heaven and earth to make better days.
Well, that's my commitment to you: to show you democracy, democracy, democracy is still the way.
If Black men are being killed on the streets, we bear witness. For me, that means to call out the poison of white supremacy, to root out systemic racism.
I stood up for George -- with George Floyd's family to help create a country where you don't need to have that talk with your son or grandson as they get pulled over.
Instead of a trail of broken promises, we're investing more money than ever in Black families and Black communities. We're reconnecting Black neighborhoods cut off by old highways and decades of disinvestment where no one cared about the community.
We've delivered checks in pockets to reduce child -- Black child poverty to the lowest rate in history. We're removing every lead pipe in America so every child can drink clean water without fear of brain damage, and then can't afford to remove the lead pipes themselves.
We're delivering affordable high-speed Internet so no child has to sit in their parents' car or do their homework in a parking lot outside of McDonald's.
Instead of forcing you to prove you're 10 times better, we're breaking down doors so you have 100 times more opportunities: good-paying jobs you can raise a family on in your neighborhood -- (applause); capital to start small business and loans to buy homes; health insurance, prescriptions drugs, housing that's more affordable and accessible.
I've walked the picket line and defended the rights of workers. I'm relieving the burden of student debt -- many of you have already had the benefit of it -- (applause) -- so I [you] can chase your dreams and grow the economy.
When the Supreme Court told me I couldn't, I found two other ways to do it. (Applause.) And we were able to do it, because it grows the economy.
And I -- in addition to the original $7 billion investment in HBCUs, I'm investing 16 billion more dollars -- (applause) -- more in our history, because you're vital to our nation. Most HBCUs don't have the endowments. The jobs of the future require sophisticated laboratories, sophisticated oppor- -- opportunity on campus.
We're opening doors so you can walk into a life of generational wealth, to be providers and leaders for your families and communities. Today, record numbers of Black Americans have jobs, health insurance, and more [wealth] than ever.
Democracy is also about hearing and heeding your generation's call to a community free of gun violence and a planet free of climate crisis and showing your power to change the world.
But I also know some of you ask: What is democracy if we can't stop wars that break out and break our hearts?
In a democracy, we debate and dissent about America's role in the world.
I want to say this very clearly. I support peaceful, nonviolent protest. Your voices should be heard, and I promise you I hear them. I determined to make my c- -- my administration look like America. I have more African Americans in high places, including on the Court, than any president in American history -- (applause) -- because I need the input.
What's happening in Gaza and Israel is heartbreaking. Hamas's vicious attack on Israel, killing innocent lives and holding people hostage. I was there nine days after, s- -- pictures of tying a mother and a daughter with a rope, pouring kerosene on them, burning them and watching as they died. Innocent Palestinians caught in the middle of all this: men, women, and children killed or displaced in despite -- in desperate need of water, food, and medicine. It's a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
That's why I've called for an immediate ceasefire -- an immediate ceasefire to stop the fighting -- (applause) -- bring the hostages home. And I've been working on a deal as we speak, working around the clock to lead an international effort to get more aid into Gaza, rebuild Gaza.
I'm also working around the clock for more than just one ceasefire. I'm working to bring the region together. I'm working to build a lasting, durable peace. Because the question is, as you see what's going on in Israel today: What after? What after Hamas? What happens then? What happens in Gaza? What rights do the Palestinian people have? I'm working to make sure we finally get a two-state solution -- the only solution -- (applause) -- for two people to live in peace, security, and dignity.
This is one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world. And there's nothing easy about it. I know it angered and frustrates many of you, including my family. But most of all, I know it breaks your heart. It breaks mine as well.
Leadership is about fighting through the most intractable problems. It's about challenging anger, frustration, and heartbreak to find a solution. It's about doing what you believe is right, even when it's hard and lonely.
You're all future leaders, every one of you graduating today. And that's not hyperbole. You're future leaders, all of you. You'll face complicated, tough moments. In these moments, you'll listen to others, but you'll have to decide, guided by knowledge, conviction, principle, and your own moral compass.
And the desire to know what freedom is, what it can be is the heart and soul of why this college was founded in the first place, proving that a free nation is born in the hearts of men spellbound by freedom. But the -- that's the magic of Morehouse. That's the magic of America.
But let's be clear what happens to you and your family when old ghosts in new garments seize power, extremists come for the freedoms you thought belonged to you and everyone.
Today in Georgia, they won't allow water to be available to you while you wait in line to vote in an election. What in the hell is that all about? (Applause.) I'm serious. Think about it. And then the constant attacks on Black election workers who count your vote.
Insurrectionists who storm the Capitol with Confederate flags are called ""patriots"" by some. Not in my house. (Applause.) Black police officers, Black veterans protecting the Capitol were called another word, as you'll recall.
They also say out loud, these other groups, immigrants ""poison the blood"" of our country, like the Grand Wizard and fascists said in the past. But you know and I know we all bleed the same color. In America, we're all created equal. (Applause.)
Extremists close the doors of opportunity; strike down affirmative action; attack the values of diversity, equality, and inclusion.
I never thought when I was graduating in 1968 -- as your honoree just was -- we talked about -- I never thought I'd be in -- present in a time when there's a national effort to ban books -- not to write history but to erase history.
They don't see you in the future of America. But they're wrong. To me, we make history, not erase it. We know Black history is American history. (Applause.)
Many of you graduates don't know me, but check my record, you'll know what I'm saying I mean from my gut.
And we know Black men are going to help us, lead us to the future -- Black men from this class, in this university. (Applause.)
But, graduates, this is what we're up against: extremist forces aligned against the meaning and message of Morehouse. And they peddle a fiction, a caricature what being a man is about -- tough talk, abusing power, bigotry. Their idea of being a man is toxic. I ran into them all the time when I was younger. They got -- all right, I don't want to get started. (Laughter.)
But that's not you. It's not us. You all know and demonstrate what it really means to be a man. Being a man is about the strength of respect and dignity. It's about showing up because it's too late if you have to ask. It's about giving hate no safe harbor and leaving no one behind and defending freedoms. It's about standing up to the abuse of power, whether physical, economic, or psychological. It's about knowing faith without works is dead. (Applause.)
Look -- and you're doing the work. Today, I look out at all you graduates and I see the next generation of Morehouse men who are doctors and researchers curing cancer; artists shaping our culture; fearless journalists and intellectuals challenging convention. I see preachers and advocates who might even join another Morehouse man in the United States Senate.
You can clap for him. He's a good man. (Applause.)
As I said, I'm proud to have the most diverse administration in history to tap into the full talents of our nation. I'm also proud of putting the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court. (Applause.) And I have no doubt, one day a Morehouse man will be on that Court as well. (Applause.) You know it.
I've been vice president to the first Black president and become my close friend and president to the first woman vice president. (Applause.) Wh- -- I have no idea -- no doubt that a Morehouse man will be president one day, just after an AKA from Howard. (Laughter and applause.) She's tough, guys. (Laughter.)
Look, let me close with this. I know I don't look like I've been around very long. (Laughter.) (The President makes the sign of the cross.) But in my career, for the first 30 years, I was told, ""You're too young, kid."" They used to stop me from getting on the Senate elevator when I first got there, for real. Now, I'm too old.
Whether you're young or old, I know what endures: The strength and wisdom of faith endures. And I hope -- my hope for you is -- my challenge to you is that you still keep the faith so long as you can.
That cap on your head proves you've earned your crown. The question is now, 25 years from now, 50 years from now, when you're asked to stand and address the next generation of Morehouse men, what will you say you did with that power you've earned? What will you say you've done for your family, for your community, your country when it mattered most?
I know what we can do. Together, we're capable of building a democracy worthy of our dreams; a future where every -- even more of your brothers and sisters can follow their dreams; a boundless future where your legacies lift us up t- -- so those who follow; a bigger, brighter future that proves the American Dream is big enough for everyone to succeed.
Class of 2024, four years ago, it felt probably like Saturday. Four years later, you made it to Sunday, to commencement, to the beginning. And with faith and determination, you can push the sun above the horizon once more. You can reveal a light hope -- and that's not -- I'm not kidding -- for yourself and for your nation.
""The prayers of a righteous man availeth much."" A righteous man. A good man. A Morehouse man.
God bless you all. We're expecting a lot from you.
Thank you. (Applause.)"
6,"May 19, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Rev.
AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, have a seat.
I don't feel tired. I feel inspired. (Applause.)
Hello, Detroit. My name is Joe Biden, and I'm a lifetime member of the NAACP. (Applause.) As a matter of fact, the first organization I ever joined was the NAACP. Didn't get to vote until you were 21 in those days, but I got involved in civil rights when I was 15.
And, folks, look, I want to thank Reverend Anthony for that introduction. I tell you what, I measure the significance of an award based on the character and the consequence of those organizations bestowing it.
And I love Detroit for three reasons. Number one, my dad was an automobile manager. Detroit put food on our table every night. (Applause.) Oh, not a joke. Not a joke.
And when I was vice president, things were kind of bad during the pandemic [recession], and what happened was Barack said to me, ""Go to Detroit and help fix it."" Well, poor mayor, he spent more time with me than he ever thought he was going to have to. (Laughter.) God love you.
PARTICIPANT: Love you.
THE PRESIDENT: Folks, I'm humbled to receive this organization [award], which defines the character and consequence of what we do. I'm always grateful to Derrick Johnson, the leadership for the NAACP. (Applause.)
Of course, thanks to all the members of the biggest NAACP branch in America -- in Detroit. (Applause.)
And it's great to see so many friends, including Debbie Stabenow. I'm going to miss her in Washington, but she's not going to get away because I'm going to keep coming to her for advice. I'll always be your friend and seek your counsel.
And Governor Gretchen Whitmer is my co-chair of my campaign. (Applause.) Senator Gary Peters and Mayor Mike Duggan -- you know, Mike Duggan is a -- I brag about him all the time. I think Mike is one of the best mayors in the entire United States of America, and you know I mean that. (Applause.)
All the members of the congressional ge- -- the delegation and all other local leaders.
Look, folks, I just came from Atlanta, where I delivered a commencement at Morehouse College. (Applause.) It was truly inspiresing [inspiring]: over 400 young Black men who will do extraordinary things.
I told them I saw them, I heard them, and the nation needs them. They're the future of this country.
And I'm here tonight to say the nation also needs all of you. And I mean that sincerely. You matter. You matter.
Let's be clear. Because of your vote, it's the only reason I'm standing here as President of the United States of America, period. (Applause.) Again, that's not a joke. That's a fact. You're the reason Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. You're the reason Donald Trump is the defeated former president. (Applause.) And you're the reason Donald Trump is going to be a loser again. (Applause.)
You placed enormous faith in me. I've tried my best to honor the trust by doing everything in my power to get us through one of the toughest periods in our history.
We got through the pandemic. We're investing more money than ever in Black families and communities. We delivered checks to deposit in people's pockets to reduce Black child poverty.
We're reconnecting Black neighborhoods cut off by old highways and decades of disinvestment, including here in Detroit. We're removing every lead pipe so every child, particularly in neighborhoods that are on the brink, can drink clean water without fear of brain damage.
We're making the most significant investment ever in climate, including the most significant action on environmental justice ever. Every child in America deserves to ble- -- bre- -- breathe clean air.
We're delivering affordable high-speed Internet so no child has to do their homework outside a McDonald's parking lot.
I promised we'd be the best -- we'd beat -- finally beat Pharma. As a senator, I tried for years to take them on. We finally did -- $35 a month insulin for seniors instead of $400 a month or more. (Applause.) And we capped the total out-of-pocket costs for seniors at $2,000 a year, no matter how high their prescription costs are. Expensive cancer drugs can cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 a year.
This year, Medicare is negotiating to lower prices for the costliest drugs on the market to treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. These reforms not only save people money and their lives, it saves the taxpayer $160 billion -- (applause) -- because Medicare doesn't have to pay those exorbitant prices.
On my watch, more Black Americans have health insurance than ever in all of history. I protected and expanded the Affordable Care Act, saving millions of families $800,000 in prem- -- $8,000 [$800] in -- a year in premiums.
My administration has taken the most significant action to provide student debt relief ever. (Applause.) Over 4.5 million Americans, includes a significant number of Black borrowers, had their debts wiped out. And incidentally, it helps grow the economy. And I'm not finished yet.
We're investing a record $16 billion in HBCUs -- (applause) -- $16 billion, more than ever, because you're critical to our nation's growth and the opportunities for African American women and men.
We're increasing access to capital to start business and loans to buy homes. We're cracking down on corporate landlords who [to] keep rents down. Our policies are resulting in historic lows of Black unemployment. Black small businesses are starting up at the fastest rate they have in 30 years. We're opening the doors to generational wealth. In fact, the racial wealth gap is its lowest level in 20 years. But there's much more to do.
I kept another commitment: to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. (Applause.) It matters. It matters. Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
By the way, I've appointed more Black women to the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal than every other president in American history combined. (Applause.)
People are now realizing how critical those Supreme Court appointments are. Overall, I've appointed nearly 200 judges to the federal bench.
We passed the most significant gun safety law in decades. And I will not stop until I once again am able to ban assault weapons in America. (Applause.)
But, folks, all that progress is at risk. Trump is trying to make the country forget just how dark things were and unsettling things were when he was president.
But we'll never forget. We'll never forget him lying about how serious the pandemic was, telling Americans, ""Just inject bleach."" I think that's what he did. That's why he's so screwy. (Laughter.)
Trump wants to give power back to Big Pharma, charge exorbitant prices again. He wants to take seniors back to paying $400 a month for insulin instead of $35. He'd eliminate the $2,000 cap that I've set that no senior ever has to pay for -- on a yearly basis more than $2,000 for all prescriptions, including those (inaudible) needed drugs for cancer and many other things that can cost as much as $14-, $15,000 a year -- the medicines you need in order to live.
Look, folks, on my watch, 20 million Americans have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) MAGA Republicans have tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times, and Trump is still determined to do it. In his words, he wants to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, which would deny 3 million Black Americans health insurance, deny protections for preexisting conditions for millions more Americans. But we're going to deny Trump. (Applause.)
During his presidency, he enacted a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefitted the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the federal deficit. These Republicans talk about the debt. Well, guess what? He racked up more federal debt than any previous presidential term in all of American history. And now he wants to do it again.
At the same time, he's determined to cut Social Security and Medicare.
Folks, I have a better ti- -- [idea]. I'll protect it -- Medicare and Social Security -- by making the very wealthy finally begin to pay their fair share. (Applause.)
Look, I'm a union guy. (Applause.) I want to remind everybody: Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America. And unions built the middle class. (Applause.) I walked the picket line with union workers here in Michigan. At the same time, Trump went to a yon- -- nonunion shop to show his disrespect for union workers.
He brags about getting Roe v. Wade overturned. He not only denies reproductive freedom but worsens the mortality rate for Black moms, who have [are] nearly three times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than a white woman.
Trump openly encourages voter suppression and election subversion.
He and his MAGA extremists gutted affirmative action.
Let me ask you: If he's reelected, who do you think he'll put on the Supreme Court? You think he'll put anybody who has a brain? (Applause.)
Folks, look, as Dr. King said, ""Give us the ballot. We'll put judges on the bench who will judge justly and do mercy.""
Reelect Kamala and me and a Democratic Congress, and we will help the NAACP. We will sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, the Freedom to Vote Act, and make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. (Applause.)
Look, the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion are the core strength of America. That's why I'm proud to have the most diverse administration in history to tap into the full talents of our country. I promised you, when I was president, I would have an administration that looked like America. We have more Afrin- A- -- African Americans; we have more women; we have more minorities in our administration than any other administration in all of history. That's why we're doing so damn well. (Applause.)
Folks, I never imagined that in 2024 there would be folks wanting to ban books in America. What in God's name is that about? Not only that, they're trying to erase Black history, literally. They're wrong. They don't understand Black history is American history. (Applause.) Not a joke.
Together, we make history; we do not erase history.
But, folks, the threat that Trump poses is greater in a second term than the first. It's clear that when he lost in 2020 -- and I mean this sincerely -- something snapped in Trump. He just can't accept he lost, and he lost it.
That's why on January 6th -- what happened? Every legal avenue Trump tried to challenge the election failed, so he unleashed an insurrection.
And now he's running again. And he's not only obsessed with -- about losing 2020, he's clearly unhinged.
Just listen to him. He calls the irrectionists [insurrectionists] who stormed Capitol Hill ""patriots."" He says, if reelected, he wants, quote, ""every"" one of them pardoned.
Let me ask you, what do you think he would've done on January the 6th if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? No, I'm serious. (Applause.) What do you think? I can only imagine.
This time, he's telling people -- he's being more honest -- he said, ""I'll be a dictator on day one."" Asked if he thought violence would occur if he lost, he said, quote, ""It depends.""
How can it be that any American president cannot denounce political violence? I know I can, I will, and I have. Political violence has no place in America, period. (Applause.)
But that's not Donald Trump. Donald Trump has said, if he loses again in November, there will be, quote, ""bloodshed"" [""bloodbath""]. What in God's name are we talking about here? This is the United States of America.
Folks, Trump isn't running to lead America. He's running for revenge. But revenge is no way to lead a country. You can't build a future on revenge. You can't build better lives through revenge.
That's why I'm running to lead America into the future, a future of promise and hope and possibilities, because that's who we are: a nation of possibilities. (Applause.)
Look, folks, let me close with this. On Friday, I joined the NAACP at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. We honored the 70th anniversary of Brown v. the Board of Education. I spent time with the plaintiffs and their families in the Oval Office at the White House. And I also met with members of the Little Rock Nine.
One year after Brown vs. Board, Vivian Malone and James Hood reached the doors of the University of Alabama. They were blocked by hate and the governor of Alabama. Back in Washington, President Kennedy addressed the nation, warning of the moral crisis, bigotry that was facing the nation. He announced the landmark civil rights bill.
Late that night, in Jackson, Mississippi, an NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated outside his home. Earlier this month, I posthumously awarded Medgar Evers the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest civilian honor. (Applause.) His spirit endures. The NAAC [NAACP] spirit endures.
Folks, what is at risk in 2024 are our freedoms, our very democracy. And that's not hyperbole. That's why I need you.
Imagine the future we can build together. I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see a future where we protect our freedoms, don't take them away. I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy begin to pay their fair share in taxes so we can pay for childcare, eldercare, paid leave, and so much more that good could -- the economy could reduce the federal deficit.
I see a future where we save the planet from a climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
Above all, I see a future where the full promise of America is available to all Americans, regardless of religion, race, or background.
Folks, the idea of America is that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never fully walked away from it either.
But Trump will. I will not. I know we -- you won't either.
We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there's nothing -- nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. And there's no better outfit to do it with than the NAACP.
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.)
REVEREND ANTHONY: Hello. Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the James Weldon Johnson Lifetime Achievement Award to President Joseph R. Biden. ""Let us march on 'til victory is won."" (Applause.)
(The President receives the James Weldon Johnson Lifetime Achievement Award.)
THE PRESIDENT: Folks, I'm going to say one more thing. My state was a slave state, to its great shame. My state was segregated by law. My state needed to change. The Democratic Party in my state used to be recalcitrant, used to be more Southern than it was Northeastern.
So, when I get old enough to register to vote, I could not bring myself to register as a Republican, but I could not register as a Democrat at the time, because I joined an organization to try to change the party. And that organization, the first one I joined, I had to register as a ""decline"" -- decline to state what you are.
But I already was part of a party that was changing the nation and my state: the NAACP. God love you all for what you do. (Applause.)"
7,"May 19, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Well, it's great to see you all. It's great to see you all.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's great to see you.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. No, thank you.
Well, I tell you what, we're -- we got a long way to go we- -- in this election, but we're feeling real good because of folks like you.
You know, we -- been working real hard. We're going to make sure that we give -- you know, we used to have this theory in American economics, which was everything would trickle down. You know, like, if the wealthy did very well, there'd be enough left over for everybody else.
My dad used to have a -- an expression. He said, ""Nothing trickled down on our table, Joey. Nothing trickled down on our table."" So, we're building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, and the wealthy can still do well, but they ought to start paying their taxes so we can do a lot more things.
Anyway, we've been -- so far, we've been pretty good. We've had the lowest unemployment rate for a long, long time. We've been in a situation where we've -- I've forgiven an awful lot of debt from the folks who have college debt -- and billions of dollars of it -- so people can start their lives again, people be in a good shape. We're going to -- we're -- anyway, there's a lot going on.
And I just want to tell you -- I was talking to -- we got three reverends back there. I -- I saw them at the airport. In addition to asking them to pray like hell for me -- (laughter) -- I asked their advice on a bunch of things.
But all kidding aside, there's a lot we can do. And, you know, the days of -- I come from a -- the state of Delaware. And Delaware is small, but we have the eighth largest African American population in the country as a percent of population.
And to our great shame, we were segregated by law, like down here. We -- and that's how I got involved in politics early on as a kid.
I was -- I became a lawyer when -- Dr. King was one of my heroes, like many of my generation. And when he was assassinated, we had the National Guard stationed on our streets on every street corner of the city of Wilmington for nine months, longer than any time of occupation of any time since the Civil War.
And I got out of law school -- I'm the first in my family ever to go to college. And I got out of law school and had a job with a fancy law firm, and I quit and became a public defender. And one thing led to another, here I am.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, that was right. I didn't -- I didn't plan on it. But -- but like an awful lot of folks growing up in a situation where -- basically, middle class family; three-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. You know, we were okay. I mean, we didn't have any money, but we were okay.
And -- but there's no reason why we can't really fundamentally change things now. We're on the cusp. And the ba- -- the bottom line -- I won't -- I'm not going to give you a whole speech here, but the bottom line is: The guy we're running against wants to back up all the -- all the prospects, all the progress we made.
He wants to do away with the environmental stuff. He wants to take away -- you know, there's 3 million more people -- African Americans who have health insurance now because we were able to increase it, been able to get to college because of it.
He wants to do -- cut all that across the board.
So, as they say where I come from, this guy is a different breed of cat. He's not your typical Republican.
And so, I appreciate you looking me over. And if I'm able to do this -- I hope it's okay -- I'll just wander around and talk to you all privately -- not private but, you know, just talk to you, find out what's on your mind. Does that makes sense?
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: And I tell you what, man. It took a long time, didn't it?"
8,"May 18, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Who's that good-looking guy on the end there? (Laughter.) How old are you?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thirteen, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Thirteen. You got to remember me when you're president, okay?
Thank you, Arthur, for that introduction and for representing something so special. You're a business titan who is a true community leader, who works for everybody every day to lift up everyone. And whether it's the Falcons or United, your -- your philanthropy has made a -- always made a big difference -- a big -- a big difference in this city. And it's always about the fans; it's always about the people. That's America.
And I also want to thank members of Congress who are here: Nikema; Lucy -- I'm looking around here -- Sanford Bishop is right here -- there -- there you go; Joyce Beatty, I -- former senator and dear friend Sam Nunn. By the way, the -- I could hear -- I could barely hear, but I thought I heard the reference to Sam.
You know, Sam and I came the same year to the United States Senate, and we served together a long, long time. (Applause.) I got there in -- in January of 1973. And, you know, I can say without fear of contradiction there wasn't a single member on either of the aisle that didn't respect Sam Nunn's judgement, his integrity. And the thing the most known about Sam was he was a man of absolute, total integrity. But he also was the most informed man on foreign policy and national security of anybody I've ever served with and continues to be.
Sam, it was an honor serving with you, pal. It really was. (Applause.)
As well as Ambassador Gordon Giffin. He was a -- a deputy, a former -- and, by the way, you have a -- someone here, a former Deputy Attorney General of the Obama-Biden administration, who I warned her, ""If I win, watch out"" -- (laughter) -- Sally Yates. Sally, stand up. (Inaudible.) (Applause.)
And let me start with another quote of John Lewis. My wife sent the messages -- we -- because we're always passing in the night, almost, we're working so many different places. And when she wants a message to get to me, she tapes it on the mirror where I shave. (Laughter.) And she has John Lewis's -- another quote John Lewis has that is literally taped on my bathroom mirror. It says, ""Democracy is not a state; it's an act. And each generation must do its part."" And that's why we're here, in my view. We have to do our part because democracy is at stake.
Folks, thank you for your support. I tell people that if you ever doubt the power of the vote, come visit Georgia, because what you've all done is incredible. You're the reason -- not a joke -- Georgia is the reason I'm President of the United States right now. (Applause.) You're the reason why we have a historic Vice President, Kamala Harris. And you're the reason -- (applause) -- and you're the reason we were able to defeat the former President, and you're the reason we're going to beat him again. (Applause.)
We feel good about the state of the race. There's a lot to do. We know we're far from over, but we know the race is close. Polls vary from me being up to down to tied. But it's harder to make any poll rational these days. I'm -- I'm serious, because you have to make so many calls. Landlines are not there. Anyway, it goes on and on.
But there are a few things we find very encouraging. First, we run strongest among likely voters in all those polls. Second -- and that's a good sign. So, we are -- while the national polls basically have us tied with registered voters, in most of those same polls, we're up four points with likely voters. But they're all still too close.
Second, if you look at the actual votes in primaries, as opposed to the polls, we're running much stronger than Mr. Trump is.
Trump continues to lose a big chunk of Republicans in his primaries. For example, he just lost 120,000 votes to Nikki Haley, who's been out of the race for some time, in the Indiana primary, long after she dropped out. In Pennsylvania primary, he lost 150,000 votes to Nikki Haley long after she dropped out. And in Pennsylvania primary, I got over 100,000 more votes in the Democratic primary than he got in the Republican primary.
And, by the way, think about it -- if you can hold for just a second here. If you think about it, they've been wrong about everything so far in the polling. We were supposed to lose in 2020. We won. We were supposed to -- remember the red wave coming in 2022? We were going to get wiped out? We did better than any incumbent president did in a -- for -- in a pa- -- party control that we lost, I think, four or five seats. We were supposed to lose 25, 30 seats.
I know a lot of people like to look at the polls, but I look at the actual votes. Let me say, there's always going to be a place for Haley voters in my campaign. (Laughs.) They're welcome. (Laughter and applause.) Just as we welcome Lieutenant Governor Duncan. I'm grateful for his support as well.
And, by the way, we're building the -- (applause) --
We're bring- -- we're building the strongest ground campaign in the history of our country. So far, over 1.6 million individuals have contributed money to our campaign and 550,000 more than the last time.
And as Sam Nunn knows, you get -- you got how many people are actually engaged. Well, guess what? 97 percent of those contributions are under $200. People are making contributions in $5, $10, $15, $20 a week -- I mean a month. They're keeping it up. And that's ninety- -- and we've raised more money than anybody has ever raised at this point in a campaign, because of you, because of them.
In the battleground states, we've opened more than 150 field offices while Trump has opened zero -- not one single field office. We're organizing, and we're ready. Trump's MAGA Republicans are in disarray right now.
Now, let's get the message of ca- -- of the campaign. It's very straightforward. The threat Trump poses is greater in a second term than it was in the first term.
It's clear, when he lost in 2020, something snapped in Trump. I'm not being facetious; I'm being serious. He just can't accept the fact he lost, and he lost it -- he lost it. That's why January 6th happened. Every legal avenue Trump tried to change the election failed, so he unleashed an insurrection.
I sit in that dining room -- Sam knows this -- off of -- over the -- off the Oval. He sat there for three hours watching what was happening and not saying a word.
I was supposed to make a speech on the economy that day. I was elected president, not sworn in yet. And I made -- went and I -- I was in Delaware. I made a nationally televised speech on what was happening and why it had to stop.
Now he's running again. He's not only obsessed with losing in 2020; he's clearly been unhinged. And I'm not being facetious; I'm being serious. Just listen to him. He just did a long interview in TIME Magazine. Buy TIME Magazine this week. Take a look at what he -- he has said.
In that article, he said, ""A lot of people liked it when I said I'll be a dictator on day one."" ""A lot of people liked it."" Asked if he thought violence would occur if he lost, he said, ""It depends."" He calls the insurrectionists who are in prison -- he calls them ""patriots,"" and if reelected, he said he wants to pardon ""every"" -- quote, ""every one"" of them. He's saying this -- not -- I'm not saying it. It's what's coming out of his mouth.
Trump says what -- and Trump says when he loses again in November -- if he loses again, and he will, God willing -- there will be a, quote, ""bloodbath."" That's what he sai- -- his words -- not mine, his words.
He said there's nothing -- no one's -- he's not going to accept the results of the election when he loses again -- if he loses again.
It's clear the -- the people auditioning to be his vice president, look what they're doing. They're lining up. They're lining up saying -- even though they had said before they acknowledged we won the election, they're now saying, ""No, well, I really didn't mean that. Biden never did win the election."" They have to say that they don't accept the 2020 results, and when they lose again, they won't accept the results in 2020 [2024] either, because they're being asked.
You see it on television all the time: ""What -- what will you do if you lose? Will you accept the result?""
And look at what he says about reproductive freedom. He's bragging he's the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned. And he is, because of his appointments. Listen to what he said in TIME Magazine article. He said states -- quote -- ""States should monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate the abortion bans."" Monitor women's pregnancies? Prosecute them?
Folks, Trump isn't running to lead America. He's running for revenge. And it's revenge -- and, look, but revenge is no way to lead a country. You can't build a future based on revenge. You can't build a -- better lives through revenge. That's what he's -- he -- they were his words, what he's talking about.
That's why I'm not running on revenge. I'm running to lead America to -- into the future.
Look at the progress we've made so far: 15 million new jobs -- a record -- (applause) -- 15 million. More people have health insurance today than ever before in history in our -- in our entire country -- more people. And he wants to get rid of that as well. It's Obamacare now called something different -- it could be added more money to.
He took on w- -- we took on Big Pharma. Sam remembers tho- -- those fights. I used to drive my colleagues crazy on the floor talking about why drug companies could charge the rates they charged. Well, guess what? We won. We've lowered prescription drug costs, like $35 a month for insulin instead of $400 a month and so much more.
And, by the way, if any of you have a prescription and you want to get in Air Force One with me and fly to any major city in the Western Hemisphere and/or in Europe, and I'll get you that same exact drug from that same exact company for 40 to 60 percent less.
But it not only saves lives -- guess what? -- it saves taxpayers a hundred -- that one thing we did saves taxpayers $160 billion because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices.
Look, I'm so proud of the new report co-released by 20 major climate organizations, from the Sierra Club to the Sunrise Movement. Cre- -- it credited my administration with making more than 300 ac- -- taking 300 actions related to climate, conservation, public health, and clean energy. And they've endorsed me, every one of them. (Applause.) (Inaudible.)
Meanwhile, Trump is determined to get rid of my climate law because the oil companies don't like it. They hate it. He's been reported -- again, look at what he -- he's saying. It's reported he asked Big Oil to direct $1 billion to his campaign, and he said, if they did that, they'd have ""a deal."" What's the deal? He would repeal everything we've done on climate so far. In the TIME article, he says, we would just drill, drill, drill.
Look, folks, we've also made the most significant investment in science and technology innovation in generations. How can we lead the world if we're not leading the world in science and technology? It's already attracted -- our efforts have already attracted more than $866 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing -- a historic amount in such a short period of time. And we're just getting started.
And I promise you, elect me a Democratic Congress, and Kamala and I will make sure Roe v. Wade is the law of the land again. (Applause.)
Look, folks, we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, protecting freedoms. We have to keep it going, because it's all at stake.
Let me close with this. Our freedoms and our democracy are at stake in a literal sense. Not -- not hyperbole; it's real. That's why I need you so badly and why I appreciate what you're doing. I know we can do this together. And I've never been more optimistic about the future in my entire career. And I mean that. Not because I'm president, but because of the nature of the s- --
Look, I wasn't going to run again after my son died because of being in Iraq for a year in those burn pits. I wasn't going to do it. But -- and I was -- started to write a book, Sam -- another book called ""Inflection Points in History That Changed History."" And I started off talking about how the printing press changed the circumstance in Europe in the 17th century and united Europe and wa- -- and I was working my way through and how they fundamentally changed what's happening in the world.
Well, when I saw those folks come out of the fields in Charlottesville with lighted torches, carrying Nazi swastikas, singing the same antisemitic bile they sang in Europe in the '30s, and a young woman was killed. I talked to her mother. And bec- -- and the President was asked what did he think of what happened, and he said, ""There were really good people on both sides.""
That's when I decided to run. That's when (inaudible). (Applause.)
There's nothing guaranteed about democracy. And in times of exquisite change, which is occurring all around the world -- look what's happening around the world. There are actually fewer democracies today in the world than there were 10 years ago.
We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing -- nothing beyond our capacity when we set our minds to it and do it together.
Folks, look, we're in a situation where the idea -- we're the only nation in the world that I can determine -- and I'm not bad at history -- where we've come out of every crisis stronger than we went into the crisis -- stronger than we went in. No other nation. That's who we are.
But we're not acting like that. And the divisions that exists -- I -- just ask the congressman, ask the folks here about what's going on in the House of Representatives. They've already produced a budget that they -- they say they're going to pass. If it passed, they say it'll cost $2 trillion, put us in the ho- -- trillion.
Look, folks, there's a lot we can do. And I really mean it. I'm optimistic if we stay the course. We just have to stay the course. And you're allowing me to make the case. You're allowing me to make the case.
As Sam may remember, a lot of my friends in the Senate at the time, I was never really good at raising a lot of money. The last time out, when you helped me out, we spent -- we raised $1,750,000,000. I never thought that would ever happen.
Well, we're on the path to do the same thing again. Because we have to. We have to. We cannot let this man become president. Our children's future is at stake. Not a joke. And you're allowing me to make the case.
There's a lot more to say, but I've already said too much probably. And I want to thank you very much.
The last thing you need -- first of all, you know -- I'll just say: Your contributions are significant, and they really matter, especially those of my host. They really matter. But what matters almost as much is the person asking for the contribution: you all. When you contribute to me -- and people know you do; your name is listed -- they know that person is worthy of support.
You underestimate the impact you have on your peers. You underestimate the impact you have on the people that are out in the community. Because if so-and-so will give that, there must be something good about that guy. So, it really matters. Because all of you, by contributing to me, are putting yourself on the line. You're saying, ""I'm vouching for this guy.""
I give you my word, I will do all in my power never to let you down. But we have to win this race -- not for me but for America.
Thank you so much. (Applause.)
By the way, I want to tell you one thing. This young man just told me his name, and he said, ""And, by the way, I raised $6,000 for you."" (Laughter and applause.)"
9,"May 18, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)
Now, look, I realize I'm surrounded by Morehouse men. (Applause.) I want you to know I'm a Delaware State guy. Okay? (Laughter.) And the Vice President is Howard. So, you know, you guys are okay. But, you know, I mean -- well, you -- okay?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) take it.
THE PRESIDENT: Better take it. (Laughter.)
You realize how insufferable it's going to be now with my chief guy -- used to be -- what's his name? I can't think of it now. (Laughter.) Used to -- he used to be a Morehouse guy.
Wh- -- what's his name?
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Cedric.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, Cedric something! (Laughter.)
I tell you what, I'm going to Morehouse tomorrow. And, by the way, let's wish this guy happy graduation, man. (Applause.) Tomorrow.
And he made a commitment to me: When he's elected president and they say, ""Joe Biden is in the waiting room,"" he won't say, ""Joe who?"" (Laughter.) That's the commitment.
Well, look, it's good to be back. I was -- the last time I was in this room was, I think, 2014, 2015 -- in that range. And, you know, as they say in Claymont, Delaware, where I -- when we moved from Scranton, Pennsylvania, moved to a little steel town in northern Delaware called Claymont. And -- and you all brung me to the dance.
The reason we're here is because -- and all the electeds that are here -- and I don't want to start naming; I'll leave somebody out -- but you really made a gigantic difference. And everybody -- it's easy to forget, but I don't forget -- little elections in January elected two senators -- (applause) -- two.
And every- -- and re- -- I want you all to remember that when we first got elected, we were told that because everything was so close in terms of numbers, we couldn't get anything big done. We got everything done. (Applause.) Because of you. No, I'm not joking. Because of you.
From the Recovery A- -- all the way around the horn, all of it. And we're going to do a lot more.
You know, I'm -- I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to do this again. And I really mean it when I say -- the Congressman knows what I'm talking about -- we got a -- we got a tight operation. And -- and it's going to be -- I think we're going to do well.
I think -- and, you know, look, here's the deal. You hear about how, you know, we're behind in the polls. Well, so far, the polls haven't been right once.
Now that -- look, we're all -- we're either tie or slightly ahead or slightly behind. But what I look at is actual election results. And election results are in the primaries. Look at the primaries.
Well, Mr. Trump has -- he doesn't have an opponent, but he lost 120,000 votes in Pennsylvania -- didn't vote for him. (Laughter.) They voted for a woman who's no longer in the race. A hundred th- -- I'm -- they're rough numbers; I think it's 120,000, I think. In -- in Indiana, I think it was 100,000 votes.
And my point is that this is -- I'm not going to take a lot of time. I want to talk to you individually. But the fact is that this election, a lot is at stake -- lots at stake. It's not about me; it's about the alternative as well.
You know, he -- I think it's fair to say -- I won't use the exact phrase that I'd use if I was still playing ball, but my opponent is not a good loser. (Laughter.) But he is a loser. (Laughter and applause.)
And -- and I -- (laughs) -- oh, I don't want to get started. I'm going to get in trouble. (Laughter.)
But -- but the thing is, he's laid out -- and the Republicans in House, they can tell you; my colleagues can tell you -- they're laying out exactly what they're going to do if they win.
Everything you let me do, everything you helped me do, everything we've done, they want to undo -- from the climate legislation to taking -- not allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Ameri- -- people -- instead of 400 bucks a month, seniors are paying 35 bucks a month for their insulin.
There's a lot more. There's a lot more. But, look -- (applause) --
And I'll end by saying I honest to God -- and I think you think it too; I'm not sure, but I think you know -- that our democracy is really on the line. Listen to things he said.
They asked him what happens, is he going to accept the loss. He said, ""It depends."" And then he said if he loses, there's going to be a ""bloodbath.""
This is the guy who is going to -- they're his phrase.
By the way, get this week's TIME Magazine. Read what he said -- in his own words, what he said.
So, this is an important election for all the people we care about, and we care about all the American people out there. And there's a lot of hardworking folks that are trying to figure out what's going on. And we got a lot more work to do -- we made a lot of progress -- a lot more work to do.
But any rate, as my mother would say if she were here, ""Joey, hush up. You've spoken too much."" (Laughter.)
But thank you all for being here. And I'd like to come around and talk to each one of you individually, answer your questions. Okay?
Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)"
10,"May 17, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: My name is Joe Biden -- (laughter) -- and I'm a lifetime member of the NAACP. (Applause.) But I said that a little earlier to the president, and he said, ""Are your dues paid up?"" I got to check. (Laughter.) Oh, my Lord.
So many -- so many people here today. You changed the world. Seventy years ago, you changed -- I say ""the world."" That's not hyperbole. I'm not exaggerating. You not only changed the United States, you changed our role in the world in a fundamental way. I know there's a lot more to do.
President Johnson, that introduction -- thank you for your leadership. But most importantly, for the NAACP.
It's an honor to be with all of you here at the National Museum of American -- African American History and Culture. Remember we were trying to get this built for years? It's pretty neat, isn't it? Huh? (Applause.)
And, by the way, I want to thank the staff who runs this place. They do an incredible job.
Together, the NAACP and this museum are monuments to the power of Black history. And Black history is American history. It's American. (Applause.) No, I -- it's a really important thing to continue to -- we have a whole group of people out there trying to rewrite history, trying to erase history.
It's a tribute to heroes known and unknown who pursued our nation's North Star.
We're unique among all nations in the world, and I mean that. Every other nation is based on ethnicity, bas- -- based on religion and other things, but we're the only one based on an idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, and should be treated equally their whole lives -- throughout their life.
We've never fully lived up to that idea, to state the obvious, but we've never walked away from it either because of so many of you in this room and so many more. (Applause.)
Seventy years ago, when the Supreme Court ruled on Brown v. the Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, a prayer was answered in a long struggle for freedom.
Yesterday, I welcomed the family of plaintiffs of that landmark case to the White House, to the Oval Office -- their office. Once upon a time, they were excluded from certain classrooms. But 70 years later, they're inside the most important room of all, the Oval Office, where they belong. (Applause.)
They're a living reminder that ""once upon a time"" wasn't that long ago. And all the progress we've made is -- still have more to do. And there are still groups that are trying to erase it.
You know, one of the cases that led to the landmark decision was in my home state of Delaware. A Black mother from Hockessin, Delaware, joined by parents of eight other students in the -- in Claymont -- the town I moved to when we -- work ran out in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and we moved back in third grade -- moved here in third -- to Delaware in third grade. All in Claymont -- they -- they just wanted a simply proposition: They wanted their kids to be able to attend a school and be treated with dignity and respect.
They asked a man who I looked up to and really admired and helped me out as a young public defender, Louis L. Redding. He was the first man -- the first Black man ever admitted to the practice of law in the state of Delaware -- to say -- and that -- think about that.
Here's the first man -- this guy was brilliant, and he didn't get admitted till after the '50s in Delaware to the -- I mean -- well, he enlisted a young Jewish lawyer from the NAACP named Jack Greenberg to help him devise a legal strategy to get rid of the racial segregation in Delaware schools.
In 1952, in Delaware, for the first time in our country's history, in Bulah v. Gebhart and Belton v. Gebhart -- and, by the way, any Delawareans here today? Gr- -- all right. (Applause.) First time ever segregated white public schools were ordered to admit Black children.
Louis L. Redding's argument in those early Delaware cases laid the legal framework for Brown v. the Board. His story, a timeless truth about America: When we make real the promise of America for all Americans, the nation changes for the better. Everything from the economy to everything grows -- everything grows.
After Brown vs. Board decision, the public schools gradually and often much too slowly were integrated. Graduation rates for Black and Latino students increased significantly, though.
The Brown decision proves a simple idea. We learn better when we learn together.
That's why my administration is increasing funding for schools to bring together students from different backgrounds.
My Department of Education is investing $300 million, including another 20 million announced today, to support diversity in our schools. (Applause.)
We're also -- we're also funding efforts to increase diversity in the teaching profession itself because, as the president said, Black students -- but especially young Black men were rea- -- re- -- react to Black teachers. S- -- Black students who have Black teachers are significantly more likely to graduate from high school and enroll in college. It makes a difference, and it matters.
My Department of Education provided an additional almost half a billion dollars -- $450 million to ensure teachers in our schools reflect the diversity in our country, and we're just getting started. This money is going to go toward training the next generation of teachers at HBCUs, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. (Applause.)
And, by the way, not because I'm married to one, but we need to give teachers a raise. (Applause.) I mean it.
Another lesson from Brown is that every child deserves a quality education. How can we -- think -- think of this in simple terms: How can we have the strongest economy in the world without the best education in the world? (Applause.) I mean, it's not possible. That taps into the full talents of our entire nation.
And the answer starts with childhood -- early childhood education.
Because of the nation's legacy of discrimination, the Black children start school with an average of seven months behind their white peers in reading. But one year of universal, high-quality pre-K could eliminate 98 percent of that gap. Just one year. And children who go to preschool are nearly 50 percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two-year or four-year degree no matter what their background is.
That's why my administration is working to support Black children. And as soon as I came into office, I signed the American Rescue Plan. And I'm going to be political by just saying this, because we're having problems -- not one Republican voted for it -- not one. But the American Rescue Plan expanded Child Care Tax Credits that delivered monthly checks to working families that cut Black child poverty in half. (Applause.)
My Republican friends let it expire. Well, I'm going to keep fighting to reestablish it. We're going to get it reestablished. (Applause.)
And I'm going to keep fighting to make sure preschool is universal for every three- and four-year-old in America. We can afford to do this. It's not hard.
Instead of giving multibillion-dollar breaks to the super wealthy, let's make the wealthy began to pay their fair share of taxes. We can afford all this. (Applause.)
I'll just slow up for just one second here and ad-lib a little bit here because I'm going to get in trouble for doing -- keeping you longer, but -- (laughter) -- you know, we have a thousand billionaires in America. A thousand. I'm a capitalist. If you can make all that money, fine. Just pay your fair share. (Applause.)
But here's the deal, do you know what the tax -- federal tax rate is for a billionaire in America? 8.3 percent. If we just raised it to 25 percent, we'd raise 400 million -- billion dollars over the next 10 years. That could pay for all of this, cut the deficit, and do so much more. Just being -- just pay your fair share.
Look, it's not only good for children; it's good for the country when we have early education, and it grows the economy.
We're also working to ensure every child, no matter what their ZIP Code, has access to a quality education experience in K through 12. (Applause.) The American Rescue Plan delivered $130 billion to American schools -- the most ever in funding public education in our nation's history. (Applause.)
And we added another $200 -- $2 billion annually to Title I funding to support school students that are most in need. These dollars help for things like tutoring; paying teachers are for -- what they deserve; providing more advanced casework and courseworks as well.
While college degrees are still a ticket to the middle class, that ticket is becoming too expensive. Too many -- too many young people, Black students are dealing with unsustainable debts in exchange for a college degree. That's why my administration has taken the most significant action, notwithstanding the tr- -- the Supreme Court tried to stop me, to provide student debt relief -- the most supreme -- ever. (Applause.)
I've been able to relieve $160 billion in student debt -- (applause) -- to over 4.5 million Americans, including a significant number of Black borrowers. That means they can now start a family, buy a home, save for their children's school, gi- -- give back to their communities.
It also increased the maximum Pell Grant to -- by $900 -- the largest increase in a decade. And it matters because over 60 percent of Black students rely on Pell Grants to go to college.
And something I'm really proud of: We're making historic investments in Historic Black Colleges and Universities. (Applause.)
Now, I'm from Delaware, so I go along with Delaware State being the best HBCU. (Laughter.) Kamala keeps saying it's Howard. (Laughter and applause.) And I'm going now -- I'm going to Sunday to make a speech at that other place, that -- that men's col- -- More- -- Morehou- -- (laughter) -- Morehouse! (Laughter and applause.)
I got more Morehouse Men in my administration than Morehouse. (Laughter.)
But regardless of loyalties, it's clear HBCUs are vital to our nation's progress. (Applause.) I mean it. That's not hyperbole.
HBCUs are responsible for 40 percent of Black engineers in America, 50 percent of Black teachers, 70 percent of all Black doctors and dentists, 80 percent of all Black judges -- and, by the way, I put more on the bench than anybody ever has --(applause) -- and 100 percent of Black vice presidents. (Laughter and applause.) You got it.
HBCUs also don't have endowments like other colleges and universities that are able to fund research labs and so much more.
Well, Kamala and I made a commitment to lift HBCUs up, and we're keeping that commitment.
Today, I'm proud to announce, as was mentioned earlier by the president, that we've invested over $16 billion in HBCUs -- by far the most ever of any administration -- in combination of almost all administrations. (Applause.)
This investment has helped HBCUs do everything from build student housing to study climate science to create health research labs, prepare Black students for labs in industries of the future, because they don't have the endowments to do it themselves now.
But let's be clear, I know real power when I see it.
Later today, in the Oval Office, I'll be meeting with the presidents of the Divine Nine. (Applause.) You all think I'm kidding, don't you? Well, I'm proud that we're the first admi- --
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: You -- you got it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) I can tell there's no -- anyway. (Laughter.)
We're the the first administration in history to have a working group from the Divine Nine in the White House. And I asked them to do that from the very beginning.
But we know, 70 years after Brown v. Board, there are some forces trying to deny freedom of opportunity for all Americans.
A few minutes ago, I talked with some of the Little Rock Nine, who were determined to integrate a public school in Little Rock, Arkansas, 67 years ago. (Applause.)
I'd like to recognize them for their courage and her- -- if they -- if they can, would you -- if you're able, please stand and rise so we can all see you. (Applause.)
And thank God Eisenhower was president. Thank God we had someone who stood up.
The Little Rock Nine were met with vitriol and violence.
Today, the resistance comes in other insidious forms. An extreme movement led by my predecessor and his MAGA Republican allies, backed by an extreme Supreme Court, gutted affirmative action in college admissions.
My predecessor and his extreme MAGA friends are now going after diversity, equity, and inclusion all across America. They want a country for some, not for all.
And let's not kid ourselves, folks. This is the God's truth what I'm saying.
My predecessor and his extreme MAGA friends are responsible for taking away other fundamental freedoms, from the freedom to vote to the freedom to choose. But I've always believed that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed. And I mean that: everyone to succeed. (Applause.)
That's what Brown is all about. That's what we're all about. That's what America is about.
Let me close this. On Sunday, I'm attending the commencement at Morehouse College, one of our nation's most important institutions. Morehouse was founded after our nation's civil war to help prepare Black Americans who were formerly enslaved to enter the ministry, earn an education, and usher them from slavery to freedom.
The founders of Morehouse understood something fundamental: Education is linked to freedom. Because to be free means to have something that no one can ever take away from you. (Applause.)
And that's the power of an education. That's why the Brown decision we commemorate today is so important.
The work of building a democracy is -- of possibility, of a democracy worthy of our dreams starts with opening the doors of opportunity for everyone without exception. And we can do it.
We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. (Applause.) There's nothing beyond our capacity when we decide to work together.
May God bless you all. And thank you all for all the bravery you've demonstrated over the years. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Proud to be with you. Thank you."
11,"May 15, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: President Yoes, Auxiliary President Hennie, Auxiliary President Lehmann, Executive Director and good friend Jimmy Pasco, thank you for your service to our nation and for inviting me to join you once again today.
I'd also like to thank the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General Monaco and -- as well the deputy of -- the Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas; and the Director of the FBI; Secret Service; Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the U.S. Marshals Service; and the U.S. Capitol Police for their leadership.
We're also joined by my good friend, Wade Carpenter, president of the Chiefs of Police, and Ed Kelly, president of the firefighters' union.
And thank you, members of the Congress who are here today.
Two weeks ago, I was in Charlotte, North Carolina, to spend some time with the families of the eight brave police officers who were shot in the line of duty. Tragically, four of them were killed. They were husbands, fathers, heroes.
And all of you who serve and for your families left behind, you live a cho- -- a simple truth: Every time you put on that shield and walk out of the house, your family wonders if that call will come or if they'll get that terrible call somewhere during the day or night. We owe you as a nation.
This year, we honor ov- -- over 200 heroic women and men from all across the law enforcement community who made the ultimate sacrifice.
For all the families of our fallen officers, I know hearing the name of your husband, wife, father, mother, son or daughter, brother or sister brings it all back as if you got that news just 10 minutes ago. That black hole in the middle of your chest -- you feel like you're being sucked into. It's like losing part of your soul.
I know. When my son Beau spent a year in Iraq, he came home with stage four glioblastoma and was going to die, and he did. I know what it's like. I get a feeling that you all know, as well, who have lost in the past. You know, I found out there is only one thing -- at least for me, when my -- got the call that my wife and daughter were dead; when I got the call my son was about to die -- I know the only one thing that helped: family.
If you have family, hold them tight. Hold on to each other, because the day will come -- it's hard to believe -- when the thought of your husband or your wife or your son or your daughter will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. It takes a long time, but it will come. My wish for you: It'll come sooner than later.
There is a line from the English poet John Milton. He said, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" Every family of an officer stands and waits so their loved one can serve the rest of us.
I admire your courage in being here. And I hope you take comfort in the knowledge that their sacrifice will never be forgotten and then, in this extended family of women and men assembled here today, who will always be there for you -- other police officers, they'll always be there for you.
Throughout my career, I've unfortunately spoken at too many funerals of too many police officers -- extraordinary, brave, heroic public servants who kept us safe. Being a police officer is not just what you do; it's who you are.
You're just like all the women and men in law enforcement I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware. You always run toward danger as others run away from it. Most of you, even when you were kids, you did it, long before you became an officer. You run toward the cries for help knowing that you could be of help. It's part of your DNA to serve, to protect, to defend.
You represent the very best of America. You're the steel spine of this country.
Back in February, I convened a group of police chiefs at the White House to talk about the hard work you're doing to make our communities safer.
Being a cop is one hell of a lot harder than it's ever been. We expect everything of you. We expect everyone -- drug counselors, you're supposed to be, protecting people who are overdosing; social workers to kids who have been abandoned; guardians in communities flooded with weapons of fear.
That's why, since day one of my presidency, I've been working to make sure you have the tools you need to protect, the partners you need, and the community to help.
During the pandemic, I signed the American Rescue Plan that provided $350 billion to states and cities that they could use to keep communities safe, retain and hire more police officers, pay overtime and bonuses, expand benefits for disabled first responders, and support violent [violence] prevention strategies.
Places like Detroit, Toledo, Kansas City, Houston put more cops on the beat. It was one of the largest federal investments ever made in public safety.
I also signed the most sweeping gun safety law in nearly 30 years to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals, while strengthening background checks and -- for gun purchases, cracking down on illegal gun sales, reining in ""ghost guns"" that are increasingly found at crime scenes.
My Safer America Plan invests $37 billion in public safety to hire many more police officers trained in community policing, to build trust, to solve crimes faster.
I'm grateful for the partnership of Jim and the other law enforcement officers that we worked together on my executive order on policing.
My Safer America Plan also makes investments to support programs that are proven to tackle the root causes of crime, to ensure you have the psychologists and the social workers responding to crises alongside you.
We also know that police officers deal with unbelievable stress. Every time you respond to a call, execute a warrant, or conduct a traffic spot [stop], there's a tremendous risk: fear of ambush, anxiety of not knowing what's behind that door, the trauma of bearing witness to the most horrible tragedies imaginable.
That's why our administration is laser-focused on providing you with the mental health and wellness resources you need and deserve.
That's why I also signed extended benefits for families of officers who tragically died by suicide -- honoring Capitol Police officers like Howard Liebengood, who defended the Capitol on January 6th, whose dad I knew well when he served as Sergeant at Arms in the United States Senate.
We remember all our law enforcements who defend this Capitol and our democracy on that terrible day.
And Congress should also pass the Honoring Fallen Heroes Act that extends benefits to first responders who are exposed to toxic substances and die of cancer.
I know so many of you still carry the physical and invisible wounds of your service. We can never thank you enough for your courage, your service, and your sacrifice.
You risk your lives every day for the safety of the people you don't even know. That's why each of you, each and every one of you, is a hero.
It's no accident that violent crime is near a record 50-year low -- a 50-year low. It's because of extraordinary efforts by all of you in your communities, together with historic steps taken to support you -- to stop the flow of illegal guns, to hold gun traffickers accountable for crimes.
It matters, and it matters a lot.
I often say: There is no greater responsibility of government than ensuring the safety of the American people and those who sacrifice to protect us all.
We've made a lot of progress, but there's still much more to be done.
Let me close. To the families here today, my wife and I know how hard it is in different ways, but I promise you the day will come again when the memory of your loved one will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. It may take a couple seasons, but it will come.
And I hope you always remember one thing that is never fully lost: your love for them and their love for you.
God bless you all. May God protect law enforcement. And may God protect our troops. (Applause.)"

We got some important meeting and business to do in a minute. But I do want to kick it off with one comment: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
You know, first, I want to thank you for your leadership. I know it's -- I may not look it, but I've seen it for a while. I've been arou- -- I know I don't look like I've been around very long. I know that part. But -- but never before have I seen the nation ask so much of our military in so many parts of the world at the same time.
In Europe, you're equipping and training Ukrainian troops as they defend their freedom against Russia's vicious onslaught.
In Africa, you're working with our partners to take terrorists off the battlefield.
In the Indo-Pacific, you're building alliances with Australia, Philippines, Japan, and Republic of Korea and improving our relationship with India as well and putting our nation in the strongest position we can possibly be in.
In the Middle East, you have stepped up to defend against a range of unprecedented attacks on U.S. forces, Israel, and our partners across the region.
And I look forward to discussing -- I think you've been remarkable. I look forward to discussing all these issues this afternoon.
Next, I want to thank you for your commitment. I know last year hasn't been easy. I know, as you've faced crises abroad, you've also faced unnecessary chaos here at home: polarized politics, which I'm sure doesn't confuse you at all, but it does me sometimes; and potential shutdowns, performative stunts that impact on morale and readiness and too many military families.
But you keep going. And you keep showing every person, with the most heart to serve, you're made up of an incredible group of men and women. And -- and I know I've said it before, but I mean it -- I don't think there's any comparable counterargument -- you're the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen. And that's a fact.
And, you know, I've -- I've had -- I've had a vow since I've been a young senator, and that is that, you know, we have a lot of obligations but only one -- only one overwhelming obligation: to prepare those we send into harm's way with all they need and to take care of them and their families when they come home and when they don't come home.
And you've made progress on this front as well -- over the last year, in particular.
I'm proud that, for the first time in nearly a decade, rates of sexual assault and harassment are -- within active-duty forces are down. They're down. And that's because of your leadership.
And, finally, as I said a moment ago, I know I've asked a lot of you but -- and everyone in this room, but I have one more request: Please pass along my deepest thanks to all the servicemen and women under your control and under your charge. And I really mean it.
Right now, all across the world, we're defending our nation -- they're defending it. And every day, they're risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow citizens.
So, this afternoon, I look forward to discussing a whole range of things and how I can continue to help support your needs and what you're doing for us.
So, I want to thank you again for being here. And I'm going to ask the press to leave and we get down to business.
Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, why debate in June? Why do you want to debate in June? Are you worried about your position in the polls, sir?
Q: President Biden --
Q: Why do you want to debate so early, sir?
Q: Did you see Trump says he'll do a third debate? Would you? Why not -- why not debate a third time?
Q: Are you looking forward to the debates, Mr. President? Are you looking forward to the debates, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: I am.
Come on.
Q: You don't want to debate RFK, Jr.?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)"
13,"May 14, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Now, I assume you're standing in case you have to run when the rain starts. (Laughter.) Please, have a seat.
Rox, thank you very much for all you do to fight for American steelworkers. I mean that sincerely.
I -- and I want to recognize all the labor unions here today, including Steel Workers, Auto Workers, Sheet Metal Workers, AFL-CIO, IBEW, Communications Workers, Boilermakers, Machinists.
I'm proud, as Rox said, to be labeled the most pro-union President in American history. You heard me say it before: Wall Street is important, lot of good folks there, but they didn't build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class.
Folks, leaders from key American industries are here as well, including steel, aluminum, solar, semiconductors, automakers.
And members of my Cabinet are here as well. Janet Yellen -- the front row is Murderers' Row here -- (laughter) -- the Treasury Department; Julie Su, our Trade -- our -- of -- of Labor; and Katherine Tai, our nation's Trade Representative; and outstanding members of Congress as well.
From Michigan, Debbie Stabenow is here. Debbie, welcome.
And Hala- -- and Haley Stevens is here. No, I guess she -- there you are. Oh, you did make it. They told me you might not be able to make it. I'm sorry.
REPRESENTATIVE STEVENS: I'm here. (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: All right.
And Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Again, you -- smile, Debbie, it's okay. (Laughter.)
REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL: I am. I'm happy.
THE PRESIDENT: Elissa Slotkin --
Well, you should be. You -- you're -- you're responsible for a lot of this.
Thank you for joining us as I announce a series of actions to make sure American workers and American business and corporations can compete and win in the industries of the future, because that's what this is about.
The fact is that American workers are -- can outwork and outcompete anyone, as long as the competition is fair. But for too long, it hasn't been fair.
For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies across a whole range of industries: steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, solar panels -- the industries of the future -- and even critical health equipment, like gloves and masks.
China heavily subsidized all these products, pushing Chinese companies to produce far more than the rest of the world can absorb. And then dumping the excess products onto the market at unfairly low prices, driving other manufacturers around the world out of business.
You know, we -- I won't go into it, but we were talking about today about how many aluminum plants there used to be and how many there are now.
The prices are unfairly low because Chinese companies don't need to worry about a profit because the Chinese government subsidized them and subsidized them heavily.
And the Chinese relies on other anticompetitive tactics as well, like forcing the American companies to transfer their technology in order to do business in China.
I've spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping. Early on, I told him -- he said, why am I being unfair with China? (Inaudible.) I said, ""Look, we'll play by the same rules if you want. If you want to do business in China, you got to have a 51 percent Chinese owner, you got to provide access to all your intellectual property, et cetera. You want to do that in America?"" There was silence.
Sometimes they just outright steal through cyber espionage and other means. And it's been a well-documented inter- -- and internationally recognized.
When you make tactics like these, they are -- they're -- you're not competing. It's not competition. It's cheating. And we've seen the damage here in America.
To name one example, back in 2000, when cheap steel from China began to flood the market, U.S. steel towns across Pennsylvania and Ohio were hit hard. And any of you from those areas know well. More than 1,800 [18,000] ironworkers and steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Ohio lost their jobs.
I'm not going to let that happen again.
That's why today I'm announcing new tariffs in key sectors of the economy that are going to ensure that our workers are not held back by unfair trade practices.
They include a thing I'm announcing today: 25 percent tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum products. And we'll counter China's overcapacity in these industries.
And we're making major investments in clean American steel and aluminum -- clean American steel and aluminum. It's a big deal. Clean because of the way we manufacture it here -- it emits half as much carbon as steel made in China.
Last month, my administration announced the largest investment in clean manufacturing in all of history, up to $1.5 billion in six clean steel projects across America, creating and supporting thousands -- thousands of union jobs.
Next, a 100 percent tariff on electric vehicles made in China. And people say, ""Wow."" (Applause.) Because we're not going to let China flood our market, making it impossible for American automakers -- automobile -- auto manufacturers to compete fairly.
We're also implementing a 25 percent tariff on electric vehicle batteries from China and a 25 percent tariff on the critical minerals that make those batteries.
Folks, look, I'm determined that the future of the electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers. Period. (Applause.) And we'll do it by following international trade laws to do it.
American companies are investing tens of billions of dollars in electric vehicles and their batteries. And thanks to my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we're building a network of 500,000 charging stations all across America, creating thousands -- thousands of IBEW jobs across America. Electric charging stations -- (applause) -- and the reason to do this is simple: Electric charging stations have to be as easy to find as a gas station, and that's what this will be. You're not going to have to worry about -- you're taking off and you're going to be able to make it all across the country in one -- without having to figure something else out.
Our partners around the world are making similar investments. They also want a supply chain for electric vehicles that isn't dominated by unfair trade practices from China.
America can continue to buy -- Americans -- I want to make this clear, notwithstanding what the other guy is saying -- can buy any kind of car they want -- whether it's gas, electric, or hybrid -- but we're never going to allow China to fa- -- unfairly control the market for these cars. Period.
Next -- (applause) -- we're going to raise tariffs on Chinese solar panels from 25 to 50 percent. Here, again, because the Chinese government is subsidizing excess capacity, they're flooding the market. They're driving manufacturing companies out of business in Europe. But we won't let that happen here in America.
We're putting a 50 percent tariff on semiconductors made in China. These are those tiny computer -- all of you know this, but for the public -- those little, tiny computer chips, smaller than a fingertip, that power everyday lives -- everything from smartphones to automobiles to dishwashers, satellites.
Look, America invented these cheeps [chips]. But over time, we stopped making them. We invested other -- overseas. Now, thanks to my CHIPS and Science Act, one of the most significant investments ever in science and technology, we're bringing this vital industry back home where it started, in the United States of America. (Applause.)
And finally, we're putting tariffs on health equipment, like masks and gloves that nurses and doctors wear every single day. If the pandemic caught us any- -- tau- -- taught us anything, we need a secure ply- -- supply of essential supplies here at home.
Folks, these key sectors, my administration is combining investments in America with tariffs that are strategic and targeted. It's a smart approach.
Compare that to the pri- -- what the prior administration did. The -- my predecessor promised to increase American exports and boost manufacturing. But he didn't either. He failed.
He signed a trade deal with China. They were supposed to buy $200 billion more in American goods. Instead, China imports from America barely budged.
And now, Trump and his MAGA Republicans want across-the-board tariffs on all imports from all countries, if reelected. Well, that would drive up costs for families on an average of $1,500 per year each year. He simply doesn't get it.
For years, I've heard many Republicans and even Democratic friends say, ""China is not on the rise"" -- excuse me, ""China is on the rise; America is falling behind."" I've always believed they got it wrong.
America is rising. We have the best economy in the world. And since I've come into office, the GDP is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest level in over a decade, and we're standing up against Chinese government unfair economic practices now.
At the same time -- (applause) -- we're standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. I've revitalized our partnerships with the Pacific allies in India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines -- Pacific Island nations.
I've made sure the most advanced American technologies we develop or invent can be used by the Chi- -- can't be used by the Chinese government to undermine our national security.
Frankly, before it rains -- frankly, for all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.
Bottom line: I want fair competition with China, not conflict. And we're in a stronger position to win that economic competition of the 21st century against China than anyone else because we're investing in America again.
Let me close -- let me close with this. I come from Scranton, a town like a lot of working-class, middle-class neighborhoods all across America -- like Racine, Wisconsin, which I visited last week. Once a manufacturing boomtown until trickle-down economics came along, and the middle class in Racine got hollowed out.
Six years ago, my predecessor showed up carrying a golden shovel, promising, thanks to his new $10 billion, manufacturing complex would be built in Racine. He said it would be the eighth wonder of the world -- big promises that never came true. He used that golden shovel to dig a hole, and then he fell into it. (Laughter.)
Well, that's not on my -- that's not part of my -- well, I'm delivering for Racine -- delivering. Thanks to the investment of my administration, Microsoft is investing billions to build a new data center in Racine, creating thousands of good-paying jobs.
Because the view from Scranton and towns like it are a lot different than from Mar-a-Lago. It's the view where -- that money doesn't determine your worth, everyone is entitled to being treated with dignity and respect, and everyone deserves a fair shot. We leave nobody behind.
That's the America we're building together. That's why I've never been more optimistic about our future. And I'm really going fast because of the rain.
We have -- (laughter) -- that's why we have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. (Applause.) And there is nothing -- there is nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
God bless you all. And better get out of the rain.
Thank you very, very much. (Applause.)
Thank you.
Oh, we got to sign this.
Q: Mr. President, why wait three years for the tariffs?
(The presidential memorandum is signed.)
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)
Q: Mr. President --
Q: Mr. President, is Netanyahu going too far in Rafah?
Q: Mr. President, Trump said today, ""China is eating our lunch."" What do you say in response? He said, ""China is eating our lunch."" That's what Trump said today.
THE PRESIDENT: He's being feeding them a long time. (Laughter and applause.)"
14,"May 14, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Hello, hello, hello. (Applause.)
Whoa! What a crowd.
Please have a seat if you have one. (Laughs.)
Well, thank you, Judy Chu, for that introduction and for your leadership of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
By the way, I was raised early on by a guy who wa- -- became my sort of sponsor when I got here as a 30-year-old kid: Danny Inouye. (Applause.) And Norm Mineta was a close friend as well, so I got trained early on.
Thank you, leaders of the House Democratic Caucus. And, Leader Jeffries, you're here somewhere, I'm told. I can't see you, but I know you're here. And Whip Clark, Chair Aguilar, and all of the members of Congress here tonight.
Thank you, thank you, thank you also to the Asian Pacific In- -- American Institute of Congressional Studies for 30 years -- (applause) -- of empowering AAAHP [AANHPI] leaders all across the government.
And let me say, I have kept our commitment to having an administration that looks like America. I made that commitment when I got elected. (Applause.) While members of the AANHPI community at every level, led by the incredible Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris -- (applause) -- and so many here today, including my Cabinet: U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai -- (applause); Acting Labor Secretary Judy Su -- Julie Su -- (applause); Director of my Office of Science and Technology. Where -- where is Arati? Where is she? (Applause.) Stand up, kid. I like that dress. Let them see your gown. (Applause.)
And thanks to all of you -- leaders of labor, business, philanthropy, civil rights, arts, culture, and so much more.
All of you -- and I mean all of you -- represent a simple truth: There is no singular Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander identity. The diversity of cultures and breadth of your achievements that has shaped and strengthened the fabric of our country. The fastest-growing demographic in the United States, you represent how we are a nation of immigrants, a nation of dreamers, a nation of freedom.
That's the America we share. That's the America we know.
And you've made incredible progress: 15 million new jobs recorded, historic-low levels of unemployment, record small-business creation. In fact, loans from our Small Business Administration to AANHPI small business is up by 44 percent compared to the previous administration. (Applause.)
Because we extended the Child Care Tax Credit during the pandemic -- which not one Republican voted for, I might add -- we cut Asian American child poverty by nearly 25 percent to a record low. (Applause.)
The lowest [To lower] costs across the board -- we finally beat Big Pharma and gave Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices. (Applause.) We also capped insulin at $35 a month down from about $400 a month for seniors on Medicare, including for millions in this community.
Our reforms not only saved lives -- guess what? -- it saved the taxpayers $160 billion -- (applause) -- $160 -- because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices.
We're also making college more affordable by relieving student debt for millions of borrowers, including many in this community. (Applause.) That's worth clapping for, I promise you. How we can be the leader of the world without having the best education in the world, I don't understand.
We increased Pell Grants by $800 a year -- the largest increase in a decade -- which matters to 40 percent of the AANHPI students -- they rely on Pell Grants. Folks -- (applause) -- when I was growing up, $800 makes a lot of difference to a family.
More people have health insurance today than ever before. And I'm proud that my administration announced DACA recipients will finally have access to healthcare through the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.)
And, by the way, the first bill I introduced was the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and expands the number of green cards so many more families can build their American Dream together. (Applause.)
Unfortunately, those provisions were not included in the recent bipartisan border bill. That was the first bill I ever introduced when I ca- -- became president. But this bill had the majority -- that bipartisan bill has majority support in the House and Senate. But I was told that other guy -- that loser -- (laughter and applause) -- I think he's having trouble. (Laughter.)
Trump called Republicans in the -- to block that Senate bill -- got on the phone and said, ""It -- it'd be a win for Biden and a loser for him,"" so he -- they have to make sure you don't allow it to get to a vote. But he's wrong. Republicans in Congress must act because it's the right thing to do, and America needs it done. (Applause.)
Thanks to the defa- -- the decades of advocacy by so many of you, I'm proud our administration recently announced major changes in how federal government collects and reports federal data on race and ethnicity. (Applause.) By disaggregating data on a community that's so diverse, we can better serve the entire community.
After all, if our government doesn't really see the difference between Korean Americans distinctly from Filipino Americans, how in the hell can they address the needs of each community? And we've changed that with disaggregation. (Applause.)
We're also making historic investments to rebuild our roads and our bridges and -- and to lead the world in science and innovation. And that includes the most significant investment ever -- ever, ever, anywhere in the history of the world on climate. (Applause.)
I'm so proud, with your help, that the new report co-released by 20 major climate organizations -- from the -- from the Sierra Club to the Sunrise Movement -- credited our administration with making more than -- taking 300 actions related to climate, conservation, public health, and clean energy.
I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, which I know matters to the community that I mourned with. (Applause.) And I remember in Atlanta, Half Moon Bay, and Monterey Park.
This guy said -- when the last shooting occurred, he said what -- they asked him about it; he said, just ""get over it."" ""Get over it."" Ugh -- anyway. I'll be good. (Laughter.)
Together, we'll not stop until we ban assault weapons again -- this time permanently. (Applause.)
I can go on, but I'm between you and your dinner.
The point is we're -- (laughter) -- we're lowering costs; we're expanding opportunities with your help; we're protecting freedoms. That's in stark contrast to my predecessor's view of it and of you.
Look, I'll never forget him lying about the pandemic, telling Americans to inject bleach into their skin. I wonder if he did it. (Laughter.) It might explain some things. Anyway. (Laughter.)
We'll never forget the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. And I was proud to have signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act with your support to help states, cities better report, respond, prevent crime. (Applause.)
We also provided historic levels of funding to public safety in local communities that is delivering results. We're seeing near -- a near 50-year low in violent crime in America. According to the Justice Department, hate crimes targeting Asian Americans fell by 33 percent from 2021 to 2022. (Applause.)
But there's still more to do so that every community feels safe.
When Trump was in office, he enacted a $2 trillion tax cut, overwhelmingly benefitting the very wealthiest among us and the biggest corporations, that exploded the federal deficit. His administration added more to the federal debt than any previous presidential term. And now, he and the congressional Republicans want to do it all over again.
At the same time, they want to -- I love this word -- ""terminate"" -- I love the way these guys talk -- ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, which would terminate a lot of lives, denying millions of you and your families in healthcare insurance, denying protections for preexisting conditions for literally several million people.
They want to undo what they finally got done and then -- what we di- -- finally got done to make up for it. They want to -- to -- they want to give power back to Big Pharma to charge exorbitant prices on prescription drugs. This is what they're saying on the platform. Those of you in the Congress know this.
My predecessor wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. He said there's a lot of reasons you can do it ""in terms of cutting."" Not on my watch. (Applause.)
He brags about getting Roe v. Wade overturned. But Kamala and I are going to keep fighting to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. (Applause.)
And while we fight for comprehensive re- -- immigration reform, Trump continues to vilify immigrants. I can't believe the way this guy talks. He talks about immigrants as ""rapists"" and ""murderers"" -- his words, not mine. He said they are ""not people"" -- they are ""not people."" He says immigrants are ""poisoning the blood of this country.""
Folks, that's not who we are. Diversity is our strength as a nation and always has been and always will be. (Applause.) And my predecessor's prejudices lead him to obscure positions. And they [we] want a country for all of us -- that's what we want.
Let me close with this. Two years ago, I signed a landmark law to pave the way for the creation of a National Museum of Asian Americans -- which was mentioned already -- (applause) -- Native Americans [Hawaiians], Pacific Islanders History and Culture. So very proud to do so because it amplifies why we are a great nation. It matters.
But Trump and his friends want to e- -- they want to erase history, not make history. Together, we make history, all of us in this room. And that's why I see all of you and we celebrate Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander Heritage Month, including my dear friend we all miss and whose family is here tonight, Norm Mineta, who helped create this caucus. (Applause.)
Norm once said, ""Democracy is not a spectator's sport. It requires everyone's active participation. You don't have to be running for office to be a public -- be in public service,"" end of quote.
Folks, there have always been competing values and visions of what America should be. My predecessor believes we are a country of revenge and retribution. I believe we're a nation of hope and opportunity for everybody. (Applause.) We're a country of honesty, decency, faith, fairness. That's the future we're building together.
I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see a future where we protect freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy be- -- the wealthy finally begin to pay their fair share so we can provide char- -- childcare, paid leave, and so much more and still reduce the federal deficit. (Applause.) Folks, I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
Above all, I see a future for all Americans. I see a country for all Americans.
And it's because of you -- and I mean this sincerely -- I've never been more optimistic. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. (Applause.)
So, let's keep working together because we can get so much done.
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) I mean it. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you."
15,"May 13, 2024","THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. (Applause.)
Please have a seat, those who can -- those who have a chair. (Laughter.)
Well, it -- what a beautiful day. And it is so good to be with so many dear friends and so many extraordinary leaders.
And, of course, at the front and the most important of our leaders today, I have to acknowledge our president, Joe Biden, and -- (applause) -- and him welcoming everyone to the White House. And Joe Biden, as everyone here knows, is a leader of courage and conviction and a fighter for freedom, justice, and equity for all Americans. (Applause.) Yes.
And to the first Second Gentleman of the United States -- who I know is here, but I don't see him at the moment -- (laughter) -- my husband, Doug Emhoff -- (applause); to the members of our administration and the members of Congress, including the members of CAPAC; and all of the distinguished guests, including some who I welcomed last week for the first-ever AANHPI Night Market -- (applause) -- hosted at the Vice President's Residence, it is an honor to gather with all of you.
The story of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders is the story of America herself. During AANHPI Heritage Month, we honor the leaders who shaped the earliest days of our nation's history.
From the 1800s when Chinese Americans laid the tracks of the transcontinental railroad to the South Asian Americans who worked on farms and lumber mills and strengthened the agricultural base of the Pacific Coast; from the Japanese Americans of the 442nd Combat Team who defended our freedom and liberty during World War Two to the Filipino Americans who helped lead the historic Delano grape strike -- (applause) -- resulting in more fair pay and basic workplace protections for agricultural workers -- (applause) -- and then fast-forward to today, the leaders here and across our nation who continue to make history every day.
This month and every month, we honor and celebrate the heroes upon whose broad shoulders we all stand.
And as many of you may know, my mother arrived in the United States from India when she was 19 years old, by herself, never having been to America. My mother had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters -- my sister, Maya, and me -- and to end breast cancer. She was a breast cancer researcher.
My mother never asked anyone's permission to pursue her dreams. And it is because of her character, strength, and determination that within one generation I stand before you as Vice President of the United States. (Applause.)
Like so many, we were raised, all of us, to understand the value of hard work, the importance of community, and the duty we all have to have some level of concern and care about the well-being of other people and our duty, then, to do something about it.
You know, there has been something quite perverse, I think, happening in our nation over the last several years where some people would suggest that the measure of strength is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know: The true measure of strength is based on who you lift up.
In this moment, we see extremists who try to divide our nation. We see so-called leaders with the biggest pulpits and the biggest bully pulpits who encourage and incite xenophobia and hate, including anti-Asian hate. We see a full-on assault, state by state, on our most fundamental freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote, the freedom to live safe from the horror of gun violence, the freedom from hate and bigotry, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history, and the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body -- (applause) -- and not have their government tell them what to do.
And so, in this moment -- I'll close by this -- I am reminded of the words of one of my dearest friends and a mentor to me, Secretary Norm Mineta. Norm often said, ""You have two arms: one to climb the ladder of success and one to reach down and pick someone up and pull them up behind you.""
This AANHPI Heritage Month, let us all celebrate those who have lifted up our nation, and to honor their memory, let us renew our commitment to lift as we climb.
And now, it is my great privilege to introduce a leader who has inspired people around the world and who has fought for years with such courage for equity and for justice. Please welcome Lucy Liu. (Applause.)
MS. LIU: Good afternoon.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon.
MS. LIU: I am deeply honored to have been introduced by Vice President Kamala Harris -- a trailblazer, a beacon of hope for women and people of color everywhere.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MS. LIU: Her his- -- (applause). Yes, yes, let's give it up for her.
Her historic election as the first female Black and Asian American Vice President of the United States is a testament to the limitless possibilities of the American Dream. Thank you for your leadership and your inspiration.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MS. LIU: I was born and raised in New York with parents who both immigrated from China. And while we commemorate AANHPI Heritage Month here today, our household proudly celebrates it every month.
My son, Rockwell, possesses a deep awareness of our roots, exuding a profound confidence in his identity. Now, this is truly remarkable to me, especially considering the contrast to my childhood, where I felt I had to keep things secretive and distance myself from my heritage in order to have a stronger sense of belonging.
Now, as we gather to honor this heritage, and in the Rose Garden at the White House, I am struck by the irony that once inhibited my own path towards fearlessness. Our journey as Asian Americans is deeply rooted in history, marked by resilience, perseverance, and the relentless pursuit of justice.
From the struggles of our ancestors who first set foot on American soil to the generations that followed, we have contributed to the rich tapestry of this nation, shaping its history and its future. Throughout history, we have faced formidable challenges in asserting our rights, including the right to vote and be counted.
When Chinese immigrants arrived during the California Gold Rush, we battled against discrimination and practices like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, aimed at disenfranchising us. Despite these obstacles, Asian Americans have persisted in their fight for equality and representation. In 1943, there was a significant victory when this Exclusion Act was repealed.
Subsequent decades saw the gradual dismantling of discriminatory policies. Today, as we confront the ongoing challenges of voter suppression and intolerance, we remain steadfast in our commitment to democracy, inspired by the sacrifices of those who came before us and fueled by the hope of a brighter future.
It is against this backdrop of struggle and progress that I have the privilege of introducing a leader who embodies the values of equality, unity, and progress; a president who is a devoted husband, father, and grandfather and believes, like we do, in the bond of family and the pride of our immigrant heritage.
Mr. President, all of us here -- including my son, Rockwell -- stand united with you with open hearts and minds to continue this journey of collaboration to celebrate AANHPI excellence.
Esteemed guests, the 46th President of the United States, President Joe Biden. (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: My name is Joe Biden. I work for Kamala Harris. (Laughter.)
I asked her to be my vice president because I knew I needed somebody smarter than me. (Laughter.)
Folks, Happy Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander Heritage Month -- (applause) -- here in the White House.
And thank you, Lucy, for that introduction and all you do for the community, on and off the screen.
Kamala, our historic Vice President, who represents the community with such great -- with such great pride. And, Doug -- I know you're here somewhere, but wherever you are, Doug -- he's back there? Okay, anyway -- our first Second Gentleman -- (laughs) -- he's here along with so many of our friends.
Mazie and Tammy, two leaders in the United States Senate. (Applause.) There you are. And Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Representative Judy Chu. (Applause.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT: She's over there.
THE PRESIDENT: There you are, Judy.
And other members who represent the community in growing numbers in each election.
As Kamala mentioned, that includes the family of the late Norm Mineta, who was a great friend and a great leader. In fact, this year marks the 25th anniversary of the creation of the White House Initiative on Asian American, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Norm supported it.
And, by the way, I was educated by a guy who -- if I can digress for just a moment -- one of the people -- when I first got here, I didn't want to be here because I just lost my family in an accident. And there was a guy named Danny Inouye who came along. Danny had more grit and determination than anybody I ever knew. And he was a guy who stood tall. He -- and this is a guy who -- anyway, I don't want to get started, but -- (laughter) -- but he taught me an awful lot.
Several Commission members are here as well, and I want to thank them. Kamala and I are committed to having an administration -- when we go- -- got elected, we said we're going to have an administration that looks like America, and it does. We do.
We have members of every community, who so many of them are here today -- (applause) -- including our Cabinet, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. Katherine -- where is Ka- -- (applause) -- there she is. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su. (Applause.)
And above all, thanks to all of you -- leaders of labor, business, philanthropy, civil rights, arts and culture, and so much more.
All of you represent a simple truth: There is no singular Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander identity. And diversity in those cultures, the breadth of achievement has shaped the strength and fabric of this country. But it's not all the same.
The fastest-growing demographic in the United States, you represent how we are, as a nation of immigrants, a nation of dreamers, a nation of freedom.
And that's the America we share. We've made incredible progress together: 15 million new jobs -- a record; historic-low levels of unemployment; record small-business creation. In fact, loans from our Small Business Administration to the AANHPI small business is up 44 percent compared -- (applause) --
By the way, the dog is cheering for that. That was a dog up front here. (Laughter.) He's all for it. He's employed.
And, look, because we expanded the Child Care Tax Credit during the pandemic, not -- and, by the way, not one Republican voted for it -- we cut Asian American child poverty by nearly 25 percent -- a record low.
Lower costs across the board. We finally beat Big Pharma and got Medicare the ability to negotiate lower drug prices. (Applause.) For example, we capped insulin at $35 a month, down from $400. It only cost them -- it only cost them 10 bucks to make it. And seniors on Medicare, including your parents and grandparents, are beneficiaries.
It not only saves lives, but interesting fact around my Republican friends: It saves the budget $160 billion -- (applause) -- $160 billion -- because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant fees and prices.
And we're now making college more affordable by relieving student debt for millions of students, including so many in the community. And we secured the largest increase in Pell Grants in a decade. It matters now -- nearly 40 percent of N- -- AANH- -- -NHPI students rely on Pell Grants to get to college -- nearly 40 percent.
More people have health insurance today than ever before in the history of this country, including in the community. And I'm proud my administration announced DACA recipients will finally get access to healthcare through the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.)
And, by the way, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform bill in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and expands the number of green cards so more families can build their American Dream together.
And now Congress has to act and do the right thing. I'll keep mo- -- we're both going to keep pushing forward.
Thanks to decades of advocacy by so many of you, I'm proud our administration rec- -- we recently announced major changes to how federal government collects and reports federal data on race and ethnicity. By disaggregating data on the community this is -- that it so deserves, we can better serve the entire community -- individual communities.
After all, our government didn't really see Korean Americans distinctly from Filipino Americans. But how can we cress [address] each community's needs without an understanding of the specific needs? We're changing that.
We're also making historic investments to rebuild roads and bridges and lead the world in science and innovation. That includes the most significant investment ever in climate in the history of the world -- over $368 billion -- and there's so many leading the way. (Applause.)
I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, which matters, as I mourned with you in Atlanta, Monterey Park, and Half Moon Bay. I've been there to meet the families. Together, we won't stop until we finally ban assault weapons as well. (Applause.)
I can go on. But, look, the point here is we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, and protecting freedoms. That's in stark contrast to my predecessor's view of America and his view of all of you.
We'll never forget him lying about the pandemic. We'll never forget the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. I'm proud to have had to -- I'm not proud to have had to, but I'm proud to have signed and -- the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act with your support.
We've also provided historic value in funding for public safety, local communities, and it's bringing us results. We're seeing a 50-year low in violent crime in America. San Francisco, for example, anti-Asian hate crimes are down 75 percent over the last two years.
When Trump was in office, he enacted a $2 trillion tax cut, overwhelmingly benefiting the super wealthy and the very biggest corporations, that exploded the federal deficit. His administration added more to the federal debt than any previous presidential term in American history. And now, he and his congressional Republican friends want to do it again.
At the same time, he wants to, quote -- I love his terminology -- ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, kicking millions of you and your families off of insurance and taking away protections for preexisting conditions, affecting millions of people.
And Social Security and Medicare -- my predecessor says, quote, ""There's a lot we can do in terms of cutting."" Not on our watch.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Not on our watch.
THE PRESIDENT: Not on our watch.
And he brags about cutting Roe v. Wade, making sure it's overturned. But Kamala and I are going to keep fighting to restore Roe v. Wade until it's the law of the land again. (Applause.)
While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, he calls immigrants ""rapists"" and ""murderers."" He says they are ""not people"" -- they are ""not people."" He says immigrants are, quote, ""poisoning the blood of our country.""
Folks, my predecessor wants a country just for some of us. We want a country for all of us.
Let me close this. Two years ago, I signed the landmark law to pave the way for the creation of the National Museum of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander History and Culture. (Applause.) It matters.
There are those who want to erase history. But together, you're making history. We're making history.
And what I see in all of you, including some incredibly special people here today. Born in the Philippines, she came to America as a fo- -- to follow her dream. She started working at a restaurant at an airport before working her way up to become one of the best chefs in the world. And now, the first woman Asian American Executive Chef of the White House, Chef Cris. (Applause.)
Come here. Come on up here, Chef. (Applause.)
(Chef Cristeta ""Cris"" Comerford joins the President.)
She is incredible. I -- matter of fact, I was 20 pounds lighter when I came. (Laughter.)
MS. COMERFORD: Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.
MS. COMERFORD: Thank you. I love you.
THE PRESIDENT: You deserve it. Love you too.
MS. COMERFORD: Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.)
She's been here for over two decades, serving presidents of both parties. (Applause.) She's prepared dinners for heads of state, celebrities -- from everyone from Super Bowl champions to everyday heroes. And above all, she's a world-class culinary leader who leaves you with a sense of wonder about American forever -- as a forever nation of immigrants.
Look, a story all of you represent in one form or another. Maybe your family has been here for generations or you're here for the fir- -- you're the first one here. Maybe you never thought you'd be here at the White House, but you are here at the White House --the People's House, your house -- your house.
We see you. There's always been a competing set of values and visions in America that's existed never as starkly as today -- one held by my predecessor of revenge and retribution, the other of hope and opportunity that we all share -- honesty, decency, faith, fairness.
That's the future we're building together. And it's because of you. And I mean this sincerely. It's because of you I've never been more optimistic about America's future in my entire career.
We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. (Applause.) And there is nothing -- nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. And that's what we have to do, and that's what we are doing.
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.)"
16,"May 11, 2024","THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)
Well, welcome to the Sea- -- Seattle Art Museum. (Laughter.) What a magnificent place you have, Kim -- really, really, really. And thanks for that introduction -- most of all for your friendship.
The first couple of times they helped, it was their own fault. But they know better now, and they're still helping. (Laughter.) And God love you. Thank you very, very much.
And, you know, I also want to thank what I consider to be the best governor in America on environment and one of the best governors in America overall. Mr. Governor. (Applause.)
Jay and the first trouse -- first spouse, Trudi, thank you very, very much. And -- (applause) -- and I warn you -- I warn you all, if you like seeing him around Washington State, don't elect me. But if you want to see him -- if you don't mind leaving him -- having him leave this state a little bit, elect me, because I'm going to try to grab him to get him to Washington. (Laughter and applause.) You think I'm kidding. I'm not.
And your congressional delegation. A great friend -- I won't say ""old"" because she's not; I am -- Maria Cantwell. Maria, where -- where is she sitting? (Applause.) There you are.
I can't think of virtually any major issue we've ever disagreed on in all these years. I don't want to ruin your reputation. (Laughter.) But -- but it's true.
She's a significant leader. Not -- not kidding. And you know why? When you think of Maria, you think of one thing: integrity. No one ever doubts that whatever she says, she means and she's telling you the truth.
Maria, I love you, kid. You're really -- you're the best. (Applause.)
And -- and Suzan Del- -- DelBene, who is working like hell to make everything work. (Laughter.) No, I'm serious. She's putting together a real, real effort running the DNC [DCCC]. I mean -- anyway, thank you for all you're doing.
And -- (applause) -- and a woman who has more courage and hutzpah and stamina than anybody I know, Representative Jayapal. Thank you. (Applause.)
Adam Smith. Kim Schuler [Schrier]. And Marilyn -- where's Marilyn S- -- where's Marilyn Strickland? There you go. Marilyn, thank you very much.
Just what you all need: You finally get to come home on a magnificent Saturday, and you're all in here with me. (Laughter and applause.) Please forgive me. (Laughter.)
Look, before I begin, let me answer a question related to the hostage deal I get -- keep getting asked by the press and all the folks out there.
You know, there would be a ceasefire tomorrow if Hara- -- Hamas would release the hostages -- the women and the elderly and the wounded. Israel said it's up to Hamas; if they wanted to do it, we could end it tomorrow. And the ceasefire would begin tomorrow. It all has to do -- you know, we've not -- anyway, I don't want to -- I guess I shouldn't get into all this about Israel. But, you know -- well, I don't want to get going, I guess. (Laughter.)
But, look, I want to thank you for your support and -- for this campaign, especially Brad and -- and Kathy Smith. Brad, you've been -- we were -- where -- there you are. We were recently in another part of the world -- in Wisconsin doing an incredible job.
And Microsoft is investing $3 billion to build a data center in Racine to power their artificial intelligence system. It's being built on the same site that Trump promised FoxComm would build a $10 billion manufacturing center. Trump even showed up at the groundbreaking with, literally, a golden shovel -- (laughter) -- promising this would be the, quote, ""eighth wonder of the world.""
Give me a break. Anyway -- (laughter) --
And he dug this hole with the golden shovel, and then he fell into it. (Laughter.) He just keeps digging and digging more holes.
Folks, look, in fact, we feel good about the -- the state of the race. But, you know, we know the race is close.
The last four national polls have me ahead in two, him ahead in one, tied in -- for another. In the battleground states, most of the polls released this week are within the margin of error. We just had the very strong Wisconsin poll up six points.
But, look, here are a few things we find encouraging. And the polls are very difficult now. As some of you know, in your businesses you use polling, it's very difficult to get an accurate poll because not everybody has a landline. It takes x thousand call- -- not really, but th- -- scores of calls to get one response.
But what I look at -- and if you take a look at '20, '22, '23, all those races, you look at the -- what -- what the outcome of the primaries were.
First, we run strongest among likely voters in the polling data. That's a good sign. And while the national polls basically have us registered voters up by four, likely voters we're up by more.
The second point I'd like to make is the actual votes in the primaries, as opposed to the polls, we're running much stronger than Trump.
Trump continues to lose a gigantic chun- -- chunk of his Republican colleagues. Just this last week, over 120,000 people voted for a woman who dropped out of the race, Nikki Haley, in the Indiana primary -- a hundred twenty thou- -- in Pennsylvania primary, she was already out of the race and over 150,000 people voted for her in that race.
In the Pennsylvania primary, I got over 100,000 more votes in the Democratic primary than Trump did in the Republican primary. I got 900,000 votes. Trump, a little under 800,000.
I know a lot of people like to look at the polls, but I look at the actual votes as we -- for -- and if you look at a guide from '18, '20, '22, '23, and those off-year elections, it comes down to that.
Let me say there's always going to be a place for Haley voters for my campaign. (Laughter.)
And -- anyway, I won't get into what I'm predicting. But anyway --
Look, third, we're building the strongest ground game for any campaign in our country's history.
So far, 1.6 million individuals have contributed to our campaign -- 1.6 million individuals. We've raised more money than any candidate has at this spot in the campaign. And of those 1.6 million, over 97 percent contributed less than $200. They're on payment plans of $5, $10, $20, $30, $50 a month. That's how we're raising that money.
And as the candidates know here, if you want to know what's happening in the street, see what ordinary people are doing with their money.
The battleground states, we've opened up more than 150 field offices, while Trump has not opened a single, solitary one. We're organizing, and we're ready. Trump MAGA Republicans are in significant disarray.
Now let's get to the message of the campaign. Our message is straightforward. There's a lot to talk about. But the threat posed -- that Trump poses to democracy is greater than what he posed in the first term.
It's clear that when we lost the -- when he lost in 2020, something snapped in him. And I mean it sincerely. A lot of people known him well when he was in New York. But some (inaudible) -- he just can't accept the fact he's lost, and he's lost it when he lost. He really did.
That's why January 6th, every legal avenue Trump tried to change the election failed, so he unleashed an insurrection. And he did unleash the insurrection. Now he's running again.
He's not only obsessed with the losing in 2020, he's clearly unhinged. Just listen to what he's telling people. I urge you to get TIME Magazine. He's on the cover of TIME. He did a long, long interview. And he means when he says.
In the article, he said, ""A lot of people liked it when I said I'll be a dictator on day one."" I don't know -- asked if
he would -- there would be violence occur if he lost, he said, ""Well, it depends."" ""It depends"" about whether there'd be a violent --
He calls insurrectionists who are in prison -- he calls them ""patriots."" ""Patriots."" And if reelected, he wants ""every one"" of them pardoned -- ""every one"" of them pardoned.
Trump says, when he loses again, that there'll be a ""bloodbath"" if that occurs. These are his words, not mine. His words.
You know, he said he's not going to accept the results of the election when he loses again. And it's clear -- it's clear a lot of people -- a lot of people are -- how can I say it? -- auditioning for vice president, which is not unusual. But he has a litmus test. They have to say they won't accept the result- -- that they didn't accept the results of the 2020 election, and when they lose again, they'll not accept the results of the 2024 election.
This -- this is not some dictator state. What's going on?
I -- I really mean it. Have you ever, ever -- even if you're as old as I am -- (laughs) -- have you ever heard anything like that in American politics?
And look at what he's saying about reproductive freedom. He's bragging he's the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned. Listen to what he said in TIME Magazine. He said, ""The states should monitor women's pregnancies"" -- ""monitor them,"" not just -- know wh- -- ""monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who seek help."" Monitor women's pregnancies? Prosecute them?
Folks, Trump is running -- he's not running to lead America, he's running for revenge. He talks about it. ""I'll be your rev-"" -- ""I will be your revenge."" ""I will be your retribution.""
That's revenge. Every -- but -- but revenge in no ways lead -- to lead the county. And you can't. You can't build a future on revenge. You can't build better lives for people on revenge. That's why I'm not running on revenge, I'm running to lead America into the future, folks.
Look at the progress we've made: 15 million votes -- excuse me, new jobs since we got elected -- 15 million. More than any president has in that period of time in American history. More have health insurance today in America than any time in American history.
We took on Big Pharma, and we won, lowering prescription drug costs. Everybody knows somebody with insulin -- needing insulin or other major drugs they need.
Well, insulin was 400 bucks a month, now it's $35 a month, and people are able to afford it, saving lives. But what people don't also -- what we don't talk about enough is not only is it saving lives, it's saving the taxpayer $160 billion -- $160 billion -- because Medicare doesn't have to pay out that $400 and exorbitant prices.
I'm proud to say the new report co-released by 20 major climate organizations -- and, by the way, I'm not -- I'll say it again: Your governor is one of the leaders in the nation and the world on climate change -- climate organizations, from the Sierra Club to the Sunrise Movement, credited my administration with taking on more than 300 actions relating to conservation, climate, public health, and clean energy. And the Indian Nations are stepping up. And we're pro- -- we're keeping our promise to them as well.
You know, in the words of that -- the endorsement, it says, ""Biden has done more to take action to protect the environment, to protect and secure health and the -- our environment than any president in American history, and he's not done yet.""
Well, we're not done yet. We've got a long way to go. But we're on a path to be able to get it done. And we've also made the most significant investments in science, technology, innovation in generations -- so that many of you are leading the way.
Talking about science and development to you guys is like talking about, you know, football to the Philadelphia Eagles. (Laughter.) I'm an Eagles fan.
But all kidding aside, we've already attracted $6- -- $866 billion -- $866 billion in private sector investment in clean energy, manufacturing, and historic amounts in -- in such short amount of period. And we're just getting started. And you all know it.
I just signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. We're not going to stop until we once again -- I miss her; Dianne Feinstein helped me get passed, when I was a senator, the assault weapons ban. We need to get that again. It saved lives. It will save lives.
And I promise you, elect a Democratic Congress and Kamala and I will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. (Applause.)
I promise I'm not going to keep you much longer. But, folks, we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, and protecting freedoms. And we have to keep it going.
For example, Trump is determined to get rid of my climate law. He just flat out said it in that -- read that article. He said he wants to get rid of the -- the climate law because the oil companies hate it. He said he wants to ""drill, drill, drill.""
In fact, he's been reported -- he asked -- (inaudible) on television the other day -- Big Oil companies -- he met with the oil execs -- to direct a billion dollars toward his campaign, and we'd have ourselves ""a deal,"" he said. Look, what's the deal?
He'd repeal everything we've done on climate -- as he said in the TIME -- in the TIMES article, again, ""Drill, drill, drill.""
Folks, look, let me close with this. Our freedoms and our very democracy are at stake. And that's not hyperbole. I mean it. I give you my word. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. We know it.
I do an awful lot of international st- -- as you might expect. But because that's been my -- my, sort of, go-to job when I was in the Senate and when I was vice president. And I know all these heads of state, knew them before, and know the ones that are there now.
I attend all these meetings, these international con- -- conclaves with heads of state. And as I leave those meetings -- not a -- this is not a exaggeration -- half of the CEO- -- half of these CEOs -- half of the heads of state will come up and grab my arm and say, ""You can't let him win. My"" -- meaning their -- ""My democracy is at stake.""
This is the guy who says, ""Let them"" -- whether it's you're talking about the Middle East or you're talking about Europe, ""If you don't pay enough money for your own defense, go ahead, you can take the country.""
Look, this is why I need you. I know we can do this together. I've never been more optimistic about our future. We just have to remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. We're the only country, in my view, as a student of history -- the only country that's come out of every crisis we've entered stronger than we went in -- literally, not figuratively, stronger than we went in.
And we have -- and think about this. Madeleine Albright wrote about us being the essential nation. Not because I'm president; because no matter -- who leads the world in the right direction if America is not the leader? Seriously, who replaces America in that role?
And he has no notion of it. And he doesn't seem to care much about it. And so, that's why other nations are worried about their democratic future, whether it's Europe, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's the Far East, whether it's Japan, no matter where it is.
And so, there's a lot at stake. The world's looking at us. I'm going to try my best not to let you down, because we have the greatest democracy in history of the world. We're the only democracy -- we're the only country in the whole world that's built on an idea.
Every other nation in the world was built on geography, ethnicity, religion, something that unites them. But we're the only one built on an idea. And the idea -- and it's not hyperbole -- the idea is, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by"" -- we've never lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it.
This guy is ready to walk away from it. It's not who we are. Not only does the American public need us to do the right thing, but the world needs us to do the right thing. And I'll try my best not to disappoint you. Thank you. (Applause.)"
17,"May 10, 2024","I brought somebody along with me.
Vinod and Neeru, thank you. Thank you for that introduction and for your whole family. You know, one of the bad news about being a child or a nephew in a family that's deeply involved is you have no way out. [Laughter] No way out.
Thank you for inviting us to your wonderful home, because I came to see your dogs. [Laughter] As the press can tell you, I like dogs better than people sometimes. [Laughter]
Look, we're here in the home State of—Kamala sends her love. She's—she—every time I come to California, she says, ""Why am I not going?"" [Laughter]
But a special thanks to Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, who greeted me at the—as the helicopter landed here a little earlier, and I'm going to see her in a few minutes after this event.
I thank you all for your support for the campaign, and—your support for this campaign is consequential.
You know, a fact is that we've got a lot to talk about. And I want to thank you again to make sure that we know that everyone—not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm these days.
The other day, I was—you know, the—we were in a situation where this guy walked up to me and said, ""You know""—he said, ""I've got—I'm in real trouble. I'm short on cash and I'm in trouble, and I don't know what to do."" And I said, ""Donald, I can't help you."" [Laughter]
Trump is in trouble, and he knows it. After bragging about he's the reason why Roe v. Wade was overturned, he's now worried voters are going to remember that and hold him accountable for the cruelty and chaos that has been created.
Well, I've got news for Donald Trump: Voters are going to hold him accountable. They're going to hold him accountable. I highly recommend—and I don't mean this—I'm not being mean about this. But take a look at the front cover of this week's TIME magazine. Read the article—the long interview with Trump. He's on the cover. So please read it.
He said States should monitor women's pregnancies, prosecute those who violate abortion bans. Monitor women's pregnancies?
You know—but look, the chaos is nothing new for Trump. His Presidency was chaos. Trump is trying to make the country forget how dark things—and unsettling they were as he left the office. But we're not going to forget.
We'll never forget about the pandemic, who—he knew was serious, and he acknowledged it in a—but wanted to not—just keep everybody to—from responding to it.
Remember him saying the best thing to do is just invest—inject a little bleach in your arm? [Laughter] That's what he said. And he meant it. I wish he had done a little bit himself. [Laughter]
We'll never forget his love letters for the South Korean President Kim Jong Un or his admiration for Putin—what a great leader Putin is.
And here's what he said in the—in that TIME article: He may not come to aid the—the aid of an ally in Europe and/or in Asia if he felt the country wasn't paying enough for their own defense.
That's really good, isn't it? You know, well, look, I don't think any of us want to go back to any of that.
Look, look at how far we've come. We've got a long way to go. But we've created 15 million new jobs, more jobs in a 3½-year period than any President has in American history. More—with your help.
More people have health insurance today than ever before in the entire history of the country. And I—with AI coming around, we're going to be—I'm going to get a little lesson—and I mean it sincerely. I'm not joking. I've been trying to understand how we could do what you both are talking about doing. It's consequential. There's no reason why we can't change things.
And look, I've been fighting Big Pharma for a long, long time as a Senator. I could put you in Air Force One, fly you—you have your own Air Force Ones, I know, but—[laughter]—fly you to any capital in the world. If you have a prescription from a drug company here in America, I can buy that drug—that—I can have that filled for 40- to 60-percent less in Toronto, in London, in Paris, in Berlin—around the world.
And look, we're—and we finally won to say that now we can have a situation where I have—want it for all Americans, but it's only occurred—initially, I got that; then they blocked the second half—that Medicare can negotiate drug prices.
For example, all the people—all the people that are—desperately need insulin to control their diabetes, it used to cost an average 400 bucks a month. It now costs $35 a month. It's a life—[applause]. And by the way, it only costs 10 bucks to make. They're still making a good profit.
But we're in a situation, as well, where—you know, in that same legislation which they're—he says he's going to repeal if he's elected. I don't think he'll be able to do it. I pray God he won't. I pray God he won't be elected. [Laughter]
But you know, beginning in 2024 [2025; White House correction], no senior, no matter how large their prescription drug bills are, will have to make—pay more than $2,000 a year. And, God, that's still a lot of money for a lot of seniors. But guess what? Some of these cancer drugs, you know, are $12-, $14-, $15,000 a year.
It not only saves lives, but it saves the taxpayers $160 billion because Medicare no longer has to pay these exorbitant prices over the next 10 years—$160 billion saved.
I was so proud that the new report co-released on 20—by 20 major climate organizations, from the Sierra Club to Sunrise Movement, credited my administration with taking more than 300 actions to—related to climate, conservation, public health, clean energy.
You know, in their words, ""Biden has done more to take action to protect, restore, and secure our health, our environment than any President in American history has done yet.""
We got a lot—I say—I say that not like, ""Whoa."" I say that we're just beginning. There's so much we can do—so much we can do.
We also made the most significant investment in American science, technology, innovation in generations so that many of you are leading—so many of you in this room are leading the way. You're way ahead of the rest of the world.
We've already been able to attract more than $866 billion in private investment—$866 billion in private investment in clean energy and advanced manufacturing, historic amounts in such a short period of time. And I know you know better than I do: We're just getting started.
Where is it written that America is not going to lead the world? Where is it written that we can't have the most manufacturing jobs than anybody in the whole world?
And we signed the most significant gun safety—I'm not going to go into it all, but I could go on.
But look, here's the deal. The point is, we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, and protecting freedoms. And that's all at stake because Trump is determined, in his words, to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, which means you've got millions of people with preexisting conditions who would lose all their insurance—be gone.
He's determined to get rid of my climate law, which we're spending $368 billion—more money than was spent in the entire world to deal with this issue—because the oil companies hate it. In fact, it's been reported that he asked Big Oil recently—you probably saw it on national television—he asked for a direct billion dollars' campaign from—campaign contributions from them. He said it would be a real good ""deal"" for you. [Laughter]
Look, I mean, but here—you can joke about it. He means it, though. He means it.
He would repeal everything we're doing on climate. As he said in the TIME article, he wants to drill, drill, drill.
Look, during his Presidency, he exploded the Federal debt—a larger deficit increase than any President in American history. He talks about the deficit.
He's determined to cut Social Security and Medicare if he gets elected. In his own words, there's a lot of ""cutting"" we can get done. Well, let's start with his deficit.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just released a study showing his plan would cost—what—he's laid out and the Republican—the MAGA Republicans laid out a game plan for what they'd spend the money and how they'd spend it. And the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization, said his plan would cost $5 trillion over the next decade and it's fiscally reckless.
Look, folks, there's so much at stake. I know—I know you know it. I feel like I'm sometimes preaching to the choir here.
But in the months—after months of bipartisan negotiations, with one of the most conservative Members of the United States Senate from Oklahoma leading it for the Republicans—after months of it, we finally came up with the strongest border bill and the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades.
First bill I introduced when I got elected President was a bill relating to the border. This bipartisan bill that we all agreed on would require 1,500 more—1,500 more security agents on the border; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backload of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers; new policies to resolve—that can be resolved in 6 months instead of 6 years.
Right now you get—you come across, if you meet the initial tests, you get a bracelet that says come back in 6 years or—actually, it's closer to 8 years. And we can get decisions made on the spot. And that's going to have a significant impact.
If you know you're going to pay a—someone is going to smuggle you into the country, 8,500 bucks, and you know that you're going—your fate is going to be determined in 6 months and you know you're not going to be able to meet the requirements that are needed, you're not going to come. All the evidence shows people would slow down in coming and not come—not attempt to come in illegally.
More than—we agreed we'd provide more than 100 high-tech detection machines, significantly increase the ability to screen and stop smuggling of fentanyl and fentanyl products. It's killing thousands of our children.
The majority of the House and Senate Members strongly support this, but politics derailed it. You know, I thought we had a deal. I thought we were going to really begin to make some progress.
What I'm told, and you—and the press is here; I think they would acknowledge they've heard it too—that you had a whole lot of Republican—Trump on the phone calling Republicans in the Senate to start with saying, ""Don't support this bill, because if you do, you've got me as a problem. I'm coming after you.""
And why not support it? He said: ""Because it will benefit Biden. It will benefit Biden. It'll hurt me, so don't do it.""
The bill is stalled. It's stalled now, but we're not giving up.
Look, he's wrong. It'd be an enormous win for Americans. He's right about that part.
We're a—look, we're a nation of immigrants. That's why the bipartisan bill also includes the most fair and humane immigration reforms in decades. It includes a pathway for citizenship for ""Dreamers"" and so much more.
I love the way people talk about Dreamers. It's like you're 3 years old. Mom says, ""I'm taking you across the Rio Grande."" You say, ""No, Mom, leave me here."" [Laughter] Think about it.
And they've been incredible contributors to the work ethic of this country—incredible. One of the reasons why we continue to grow is, we are not xenophobic. We have input of new immigrants coming into the country that should come into the country that, in fact, are generating economic growth.
And by the way, I'm proud that my administration just announced Dreamers are finally going to be able to qualify for the Affordable Care Act and then get health insurance.
Meanwhile, in the same TIME interview, Trump vowed the U.S. military would round up the 11 million, quote, people who are waiting to be determined whether they can be here, put them in trucks and send them back, or put them in prisons.
He calls our immigrants—he'd use the military for that. He says immigrants are a bunch of ""rapists""—quote—his quotes—and ""murderers."" He said: ""They're not people. They poison the blood of our country."" His words, not mine.
Folks, we have—we need to be able to control our border. Any country does. But the way he talks about it and what he wants to do is criminal.
Folks, that's not who we are. That's not America.
Now, look, the biggest threat Trump poses is to our democracy. And some of you in the receiving line mentioned that to me as well.
You know, that TIME article—in that TIME article, he said, ""A lot of people liked it when I said I'd be a dictator for 1 day."" He means what he says. Asked if he—asked if he thought violence would occur if he lost, Trump said, ""It depends."" ""It depends."" No, I'm—that's not a joke. And you know he means it.
He's called the insurrectionists who are in prison now—he calls them ""patriots."" And if reelected, he wants to pardon ""every one"" of them, quote. ""Every one"" of them.
Trump says when he loses again—he said ""if,"" but I'm saying ""when""—[laughter]. When he loses again in November, he says there will be a ""bloodbath."" That's what he's saying. Listen to his words.
He's not going to accept the results of the election when he loses again.
And look at those all vying to be his Vice Presidential nominee, refusing to acknowledge that they would accept the results of the election. ""It would depend,"" they said. Folks, this is not America. This is not democracy.
Let me close with this. What's at risk in 2024 are our freedoms, our very democracy. And that's not hyperbole. That's why I so badly need you.
I know I don't look it, but I've run a thousand times. [Laughter] I served in the Senate a long, long time. I served as Vice President for 4 years. Every time I've run, I've wanted to win. But this time, I'm running because we have to win. We have to win. We cannot let Trump be elected President of the United States of America.
And I know we can do this together. I've never been more optimistic—I've never been more optimistic about our prospects. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, for God's sake.
We're the only country in the history of the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in—every single crisis. The only one.
And, folks, I'm taking too much of your time, but there's nothing beyond our capacity. I really mean it. Nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
We're a united nation. This is the United States of America. That's what we've got to be. We've got to unite, bring people together. And we have to build this economy from the middle out and the bottom up. The wealthy will still do very well, but you've got to give the middle class a fighting chance and the poor a shot up.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Appreciate it."
18,"May 10, 2024","The President. Well, Melissa [Marissa; White House correction] and Zach, thank you very much. I really mean it. And you have such a beautiful family. You really do.
Girls, when you get to be teenagers, it gets hard to raise daddies. [Laughter] We're easy until about age 13, when the boys start showing up. [Laughter] So you've got to be very patient with daddies.
And I told your brother he's got one important job: Keep the guys out of the house. [Laughter] Anyway.
[At this point, the audio was briefly dropped.]
You're incredible.
These two ladies here, in my view, and I mean this sincerely, are emblematic of how America is changing. You're incredibly competent. You're changing the whole notion of what constitutes success and what can be done. Both are capable of doing anything in the world they set to do. I mean it sincerely. And I just can't tell you how much you have folks looking up to you all across this country, women who look and say—[inaudible]. [Inaudible]—you're doing. Look what you're doing.
When I got elected President—I mean this sincerely—I decided I was going to have an administration that looked like—I should stay here, shouldn't I?
[The President gestured toward the podium.]
[Laughter] I was going to have an administration that looked like America, and I meant it, both in terms—we have more women in my Cabinet than we have men. We have more women in the offices, in the major positions in my administration than we have men. And we have people of color that—we have more African Americans that are in courts. We have more Hispanics.
I mean, we just decided that it's important. I mean this sincerely. I didn't plan on saying any of this until I looked at you two guys.
It's really important that people have something to look to to know what can be done, to know what can be accomplished. You could be Governor; you could be President. [Laughter] No, I mean, I'm not joking. I'm being deadly earnest. And a lot is changing.
And so Jennifer, the First Partner of California, who is doing an incredible job along with the Governor. And also, it's great to be in California with—but the only—I'm in a little bit of trouble because Kamala is not here. [Laughter] Every time I'm going to California, she says: ""What—wait, wait—I've got to go back. I've got to go back."" [Laughter] She sends her love.
And I want to thank you all for your support for this campaign.
Look, we're into the spring, and we're genuinely—there's excitement and momentum moving on—building this campaign.
So far—I don't think this has ever happened before—we have 1.6 million people who have individually contributed to this campaign—1.6 million; 97 percent have contributed under $200, and they're doing $5, $10, $20, $30 a month. And we've raised more money than anybody has ever raised—because of you, as well—at this stage in a campaign.
We've opened over 150 offices in battleground States. And you know, we've opened—and Trump has opened zero offices. And it's not just because he's in a trial, he isn't doing it at all.
Look, I think this is going to be a campaign—those women and men who play sport—tough sports. It's like—it's about blocking and tackling. It just gets down to who is going to get to—have the volunteers, who's going to knock on the doors, who's going to make those phone calls, who's going to put those signs up. It matters. Who's going to get people to the polls.
While the press doesn't want write about it, the momentum is clearly in our favor, with polls moving towards us and away from Trump.
As I left Wisconsin last week, the Wisconsin latest Quinnipiac Poll has us up 6 points among registered voters. The IPSOS/ABC Poll has us up 4 nationwide. All the rest are basically tied.
But I, quite frankly, don't think the polls mean anything today. It's awful hard to get a read of a poll. I don't know how many—my pollsters tell me that you have to contact an enormous number of people just to get a response. And there's—hardly anybody has cell phones—anything other than cell phones.
We know not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm, though, for real.
The other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and said: ""Look, Mr. President, I'm being crushed by debt. And I'm completely wiped out."" And I had to tell him, ""Donald, I can't help you."" [Laughter] ""There's nothing I can do for you."" [Laughter]
Look, Trump is in trouble, and he knows it. And after bragging about his reasons why Roe v. Wade was overturned and he was the reason for it, he now wants voters to hold—not hold him accountable for all the cruelty and chaos it's created.
And I have news for Trump: The voters aren't forgetting. They're going to hold him accountable.
Trump did a long interview, if you've seen it, in TIME magazine. If you haven't, I urge you to get it. Not a joke. He—his own words. He said, ""States should monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans."" Monitor women's pregnancies? That's just what we need a President doing.
Look at the chaos. It's nothing new for Trump. His Presidency literally was chaos. It's—and it seems like a hundred years ago.
Trump is trying to make the country forget how dark and unsettling things were during his Presidency. But we'll never forget. A million people died. A million people died because of COVID, and he kept telling people: ""Don't worry. Nothing to it. Just inject a little bleach in your arm."" For real.
Well, I wish he had injected a little beach, and we could see what was going on. [Laughter]
But look, you know—remember his love letters for Kim Jong Un of North Korea and how he admires—his admiration for Putin—said he trusted Putin over our own people?
Here's what he said in that TIME article, and you've really got to get it, because this is about alternatives too. He may not come out and aid an ally in Asia or in Europe if he thinks they haven't paid enough for their own defense. That's a great message to send.
As the press—national press is with me today, they've heard me say it before. Some of them have been with me at these international organizations I attend—the G-7, the G-20, all these various—where I meet with other heads of state.
They literally—they literally come up to me as I'm leaving and say: ""He can't win. He can't win. My""—meaning their country's—""democracy is at stake.""
Look how far we've come: 15 million new jobs. No President has ever created that many jobs in one term ever in American history. More people have health insurance today than ever before in the history of the country. Millions of people didn't have it before. And we're going to expand that.
We took on Big Pharma to lower prescription drug costs. How many people do you know who need insulin for their diabetes? They were paying roughly 400 bucks a month. Now they don't have to pay more than $35 a month. And they're still making a good profit with that.
And look, we're—it not only saves lives; it saves the taxpayer $160 billion—$160 billion—because the Federal Government doesn't have to pay out these exorbitant prices.
And so, look, I'm so proud of the new report released by the 20 major climate organizations, from the Sierra Club to the Sunrise Movement, crediting our administration with taking more than 300 related climate actions: conservation, public health, clean energy.
In their words—it sounds—I feel guilty mentioning—reading this—""Biden does more to take action and protect, restore, and secure health and the environment than any President in American history, and he's not done yet.""
We're not done yet. We're on the verge of being able to do so much more. We're just finally breaking through. We're breaking through on the ability to deal with agriculture and all the—anyway.
We've made the most significant investment in American—in science, technology—I need not tell you in Silicon Valley any of this—in generations. And so many of you are leading the way.
We've already attracted off the sidelines $866 billion—$866 billion—in private investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing—historic amounts in such a short period of time. And we're just getting started.
We—I mean, we're really—I know you—probably, it's the only place in the country that fully appreciate it. We're just getting started.
I signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. And by the way, although she's not around to help me this time, Dianne Feinstein and I passed the assault weapons ban. We're going to pass it again.
Look, I could go on. The point is, we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, and protecting freedom. But it literally is all at stake. I'm not going to take too much of your time.
Trump is still determined, in his words, to, quote, ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act. That will kick millions of people off of health care because it's the only way they can get—if you have a preexisting condition, it's the only means by which you can get insurance.
He's determined to get rid of the climate law. We're spending $368 billion on climate, more than ever spent in the entire history of the world. And we're just getting started. Why? Because—and he's—he wants to make sure that he gets—he says, if I'm not elected, he's going to eliminate it.
Did you see what he just said? You saw it on television, also out of his—his TIME magazine article. He said to the major—oil executives—he told Big Oil—he said, ""'Raise me a billion dollars,' and I said, 'That would be a hell of a deal for you'""—make a deal. And then he goes on and says he has one objective if he's reelected: Drill, drill, drill.
Look, folks, during his Presidency, he exploded the Federal deficit more than any President did in a—one term. He racked up more Federal debt than any previous President in history.
He's determined to cut Social Security and Medicare. We're going to have to deal with it, but we can do that by everybody beginning to pay their fair share. In his own words, he said, ""There's a lot you can do in terms of cutting."" And he plans on doing it.
The nonpartisan [Congressional; White House correction] Budget Office just released a study showing his plans that all—that the House of Representatives' Republicans passed as well, what they're going to do in a—if they take control next time—it would cost $5 trillion over the next decade. It's fiscally reckless—$5 trillion.
Folks, there's so, so much at stake. I know you know all this, so I should shush up.
But after months of bipartisan negotiations, I proposed the strongest border bill ever, a comprehensive immigration reform—in decades—a bipartisan bill that would require us to hire 1,500 more security agents and officers at the border; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backload of 2 million cases—there's a backload of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years and to get decisions faster.
When they do that, no one is going to pay a cowboy to take them across the border for 8,000 bucks, knowing they're going to be sent home in 6 weeks [months; White House correction].
A hundred more high-tech detection machines. We know how we can deal with fentanyl coming into the country and the biproducts.
It's just stupid what they did.
And by the way, that group that put it together was led by a very—one of the most conservative Members of the Congress in the United States Senate from Oklahoma. But the majority of the House and Senate support this bill, but politics derailed it.
Trump was on the phone, I'm told—and I have the national press here, so they—they've heard it too; they can write whether they think I'm telling the truth or not. Trump was on the phone calling Members of the House and the Senate saying: ""Don't bring that bill up. Don't pass that border bill.""
Why? ""Because it'll make Biden look like a winner. It would be a political win for Biden. Don't do it.""
Now, his ability to threaten people or have an impact on the Congress is amazing to me. And guess what? They backed off, even though the vast majority support it.
But he's wrong. It'd be an enormous win for America.
We're a nation of immigrants. That's why this bipartisan bill also includes fair and humane immigrant reform—immigration reform in decades—the most significant. It includes a pathway for citizenship for ""Dreamers"" and so much more.
And by the way, I'm proud that my administration just announced that Dreamers are finally able to get health care under the Affordable Care Act.
Look, folks, the idea these Dreamers are somehow—you know, you're 5 years old, mom says, ""Let's cross the Rio Grande,"" and you say: ""No, Mom, leave me here. I'm going to be okay""—it's ridiculous.
And by the way, it's one of the reasons why our economy is growing. We're not xenophobic. We're able to grow the economy because we have workers coming in. We have farmworkers and other workers, and it's real.
And the Governor is doing an incredible job, by the way. No, he really is.
And by the way, AMLO said—I told him what was going on down at the border in Southern California. It slowed down from 10 million people—I mean, excuse me, 500,000 people to 50,000 people.
I mean, there's a lot—there's a lot—I don't want to bore you, but there's a lot we can do and are doing.
Meanwhile, in the TIME interview, Trump vowed to use the U.S. military to round up—get the military out there, going through America, round up the 11 million Americans who are waiting for their determination of what's going to happen in their—because they're waiting now 5, 6, 7 years to be—longer to be able to have their hearings whether they can stay.
And he—and I just wonder how people feel when he calls our immigrants ""rapists"" and ""murderers."" He says, quote, ""They're not people."" The rest of the world hears this, by the way. He says immigrants ""poison the blood of America""—of our country.
Folks, that's not who we are. That's not America. And we—and it really hurts us around the world, not in terms of immigration but in terms of what kind of people we are.
Folks, the biggest threat Trump poses is to our democracy. You know, again, in that TIME article, he says, ""A lot of people liked it when I said I'll be a dictator for one day."" Well, I don't like it, because I know he means it.
Asked if he thought violence would occur if he lost, Trump says, ""Well, it depends."" Then asked if he'd recognize—he'd recognize the outcome of this next election, he said if he's not reelected, and he said no.
He calls the insurrectionists who are in prison—he calls them ""patriots."" He says, if reelected, he wants ""every one"" of them—he'll free them, pardon them.
Trump says, if he loses again in November, there'll be a ""bloodbath."" I mean, this is a President of the United States of America, for God's sake.
[The President gestured toward Representative Anna G. Eshoo.]
Oh, I didn't see you, Congresswoman. I—I apologize. I didn't——
Rep. Eshoo. That's all right.
The President. By the way, she's one of the best in the country.
He says he's not going to accept the results of the election when he loses again. You can't only love your country when you win.
MAGA candidates auditioning to be his Vice President are saying they would not accept the results, either. I don't know what it is. I mean, something is going on. It's like they're drinking some Kool-Aid.
Look, let me close with this. What's at risk in 2024 are our freedoms and our democracy. I know we can do this if we work together. I really do. We're the only country in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went into the crisis—every one.
I've never been more optimistic about our future. We have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We're the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity when we work together.
And I know I get criticized, in the light of all he's doing, to say we've got to work together. But we have to work together because I don't—this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat.
The MAGA Republicans make up somewhere between 30 and 35 percent of the Republican Party. They have a hammer on the rest of the party. But it's not who we are.
I've always been—I've been in the Senate a long time before this job. And some of the most impressive men and women I've worked with are the Republicans. But it's not there anymore. It's got to change. It's got to change.
So, with your help, not only will you help me get elected, but hopefully, we'll elect a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, and we'll get a lot done.
Thank you.
And by the way, thank these girls for getting all dressed up. [Laughter] They're all—[inaudible]—and this good-looking guy.
By the way, I made a promise—I made him give me a promise: If he or his sister ended up being President of the United States and they say, ""Joe Biden is out in the waiting room,"" promise me you won't say, ""Joe who?"" [Laughter]
Really, folks, thank you. I know there's a lot at stake. I really—[inaudible].
As I said, every time I've run in the past—and I was a Senator for 36 years and Vice President for 8 years—I've always wanted to win. But I've never before felt that it was an obligation—an obligation to win. We've got to get this done. There's too much at stake.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you."
19,"May 10, 2024","The President. Folks, thank you. I'll tell you something else—[inaudible]—get up here. I want to tell you something else. When we win, he ain't staying in Washington State.
Governor Jay R. Inslee of Washington. Uh oh! [Laughter]
The President. Go talk to Trudi. [Laughter]
Gov. Inslee. Go get it. Have fun tonight.
The President. Thank you.
Hello, Seattle! And thank you for the warm welcome. But please keep it down because—[laughter]—Donald Trump is sleeping. [Laughter] ""Sleepy Don,"" I kind of like that these days. [Laughter]
You know, I have—look, Governor Inslee, Jay, you are the leader in the country on climate change. You really are. You've done more as a Governor in your State than any Governor has in anywhere in America.
When they told us we couldn't possibly get a bipartisan agreement to spend money on climate change, we got $369 billion. When I think climate change, I think jobs.
One of the things that I know we got a little—some people got a little worried because right after I got the nomination and was elected, I didn't—I—made sure I didn't introduce my entire climate change policy for a simple reason. I wanted to bring along organized labor. Labor always thought of climate as causing them jobs—costing them jobs. But I spent time with the IBEW, starting with them, and every other major labor union in America has endorsed our climate policy, embraced it, and made it work.
So—and, Trudi, as my mother would say, no purgatory for you—[inaudible]—straight to heaven—straight to heaven. There's no such thing as being the ""first spouse."" There's no such thing. It's about—when you're the wife or the husband of a Governor, you're the Governor too. So thank you very much. No, no. You know I'm telling you the truth.
They know where you can show up. They know where you live without—""Why did we do this? Why'd we do that?"" Anyway, thank you very much.
And look, I also want to thank the Governor. The previous Governor has become a great friend of mine, and I have great faith that he ain't going nowhere either, if I make it. And that's Gary—Governor Gary Locke. Where are you, Gary?
And you want a fighter on your side, you want someone who knows what she's talking about, someone who does what she says and says what she does, Congresswoman Jayapal, who's right here.
I want to thank Nick and Lisa and all the cohosts here tonight.
Just let me say I—you know, I should have the Head and the Heart perform before every program I have, because this is an incredible crowd.
My dad, when he was high school age—he was from Baltimore—he had a band. He got into Johns Hopkins, but because of the war, he never got to go, make a long story short. But my dad played the saxophone and the clarinet. He could sing a little bit, and he could dance. He had a band.
And he said: ""Joey, I don't know where the hell you came from. You have no lip, you can't play a reed instrument."" [Laughter] ""You have two left feet and can't dance. And you can't carry a tune in the wheelbarrow. But I still love you.""
So I—[laughter]—I'm always appreciative when anybody with musical talent says something nice about me. Charity and Matthew, you're incredible. Thank you for all you do.
Look, folks, as we go into spring, we genuinely feel the excitement and momentum we're building in the campaign, and I mean that sincerely.
I think most of the Members of Congress that I've served with so long will tell you no one ever doubts I—what—I mean what I say. The problem is that I sometimes say all that I mean. [Laughter] But I'm optimistic. I'm feeling good. Feeling good about the country. We're moving.
So far, over 1.6 million individuals have contributed to our campaign—five hundred and fifty thousand—fifty-five thousand of them in just since—new since the last campaign, new contributions. And 90 percent of those contributions are under $200—people contributing $5, $10, $20, $50 dollars a month helping this campaign.
There's a genuine groundswell. People are engaged, no matter what the polling data says.
And we've opened over 150 offices in—150—one-five-zero—in battleground States. And that as—and Trump has his zero in those States. And while the press doesn't write about it, the momentum is clearly in our favor, with the polls moving towards us and away from Trump.
Earlier this week, I was in Wisconsin. The Quinnimac [Quinnipiac; White House correction] Poll had up 6 points with registered voters. The IPSOS/ABC poll has us 4 percent up.
But it's awful hard to judge the polls these days because they're so difficult to take. They don't have—most people don't answer their landlines, and so it's really up in the air. But I can tell you, we're out around the country, we're out around a lot. There's some enthusiasm. People want to get things done. Things are beginning to move. And people are beginning to focus.
And those of you who've been involved in partisan politics and going door to door and those kinds of things, people really don't get juiced until somewhere toward the end of the summer and the beginning of the fall. But we're really optimistic.
I know everyone is feeling that enthusiasm—I know not everyone is feeling that enthusiasm. The other day, a defeated-looking man came up to me and said, ""Mr. President, I'm being crushed by debt, and I'm completely wiped out."" I had to say to him, ""I'm sorry, Donald, I can't help you."" [Laughter] ""Nothing I can do to help.""
Look, Trump knows he's in trouble. You know, he has bragged about he's the reason why Roe v. Wade was overturned, and now he's worried the voters are going to remind him of that and all the cruelty and chaos that has caused.
Well, let me ask you: Are we going to hold him accountable or not? We are, right?
Trump did a long interview in TIME magazine. You ought to read—I'm being deadly earnest about this. You ought to read it. He said, quote, ""States should monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate the bans."" Monitor women's pregnancies? What have we become here?
But look, chaos is nothing new to Trump. His Presidency was a chaos. Trump is trying to make the country forget how dark and unsettling things were when he was President. But we're never going to forget.
We'll never forget the fact—him lying about the pandemic. He knew how dangerous it was, but he didn't want to—he wouldn't say it to anybody. He said, ""Just go inject a little bleach in your arm."" [Laughter] Too bad he didn't. [Laughter]
Look—all kidding aside, it was bizarre. We lost a million people. And all the data shows those million, every one of them had eight people that were significant to them: brothers, sisters, uncle, aunts, mothers, fathers, wives, children.
We're never going to forget the love—his love letters to Kim Jong Un of North Korea, talking about what a—how he could work with him, he's a good man, or his administration—his admiration for Putin, standing with Putin at a press conference after a meeting and talking about how he believed Putin, he didn't believe his own security people.
And here's what he said in that TIME magazine article. He said he—and he may—he said—straight up, I really urge you to read it so I'm not—I'm not putting words in his mouth—[inaudible]. His words. No, I really mean it. Because he means what he says.
He said he wouldn't—may not come to an aid of an ally in Europe or Asia if attacked if he felt that country hadn't been spending enough money on its own defense system—would not come to the aid.
Look, folks, I don't want any part of that.
And I spent a lot of time—my expertise is American foreign policy and climate, the two things that I've worked on the most. And, you know, I go to these international meetings, because I know personally the vast majority of the world leaders, and the new ones as well.
And every—whether it's a G-7 meeting or G-20 in any—wherever it is—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart—it's disturbing, because what will happen, as we're leaving the meetings, one of the leaders—many of them—will grab me by the arm and say: ""He can't win again. Please. My""—meaning their—""My democracy is at stake.""
Look, folks, Madeleine Albright was right. We are the essential nation. If we don't stand up, who does? Who does? If we don't unite the world, who can—in our interest?
But look how far we've come: 15 million brandnew jobs, a record, just in 3½ years. More people have health insurance today than ever before in the history of this country.
We took on Big Pharma, which I've been fighting since I was a Senator, and we finally won. Anybody knows they need insulin for their serious problems they have, it'd cost them—instead of costing them 400 bucks a month, now it costs 15 bucks a month. And it's only just beginning.
And, folks, it not only saves lives, it saves taxpayers $160 billion, because Medicare doesn't have to pay the price. That's a fact.
And with your Governor's help, we're making the most significant investment ever in climate.
I'm so proud to report that—they co-released by 20 major climate organizations, from the Sierra Club to the Sunrise Movement, it credited our administration with making more than 300 actions related to climate, conservation, public health, and clean energy.
In their words—in an endorsement: ""Biden does more to take action to protect, restore, and secure health and environment in America than any President in American history, and he's not done yet."" We are not done yet.
And as Jay will tell you, every time I had a tough decision, I'd call him, I—forget his opinion. And I'm not joking. Jay, there's no place to hide, if I make it. [Laughter] [Inaudible]—no, I'm serious. He's the best in the country.
I signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. The idea our children are going to school and learning how to duck and cover is sick. It's sick.
More children killed because of a bullet than any other reason. Think of that, in America—the United States of America. And the [former; White House correction] President is saying—thanking the—telling the National Rifle Association that, you know, he's their best friend, nothing is going to happen when he's there.
Well, guess what? Thirty years ago—it's not going to stop until we ban assault weapons again.
I apologize. I'm going on too long.
But look, the point is, we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, and protecting freedoms. But it's all at stake. It really is all at stake.
Trump is still determined, in his words, to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, which will kick millions of people off insurance. You know, it's the only reason why people with a preexisting condition are able to get insurance, tens of thousands of them.
He's determined to get rid of my climate law, and he's just flat out saying it, because the oil companies hate it.
In fact, it's been reported—you probably saw it on television. He said it in his—in—the TIME magazine article that's on the front—he's on the front cover of.
He said that he asked Big Oil, quote, ""to direct a billion dollars to his campaign."" He said it would be a good ""deal"" for them. No, I'm serious. I'm not making this stuff up. Just read it. His own words. He'd repeal everything we're doing on climate. And he said in the TIME article he wants to drill, drill, drill.
Well, folks, look, during his Presidency, he exploded the Federal deficit more than any other President had in a term—[inaudible]—the Federal deficit than any—any previous President.
And he's determined to cut Social Security and Medicare. His own words: ""There's a lot you can do in terms of cutting,"" he says.
Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just released a study—this is nothing out of my office—showing his plan for what he wants to spend the next 4 years. And he's—he laid it out, as did the MAGA Republicans in the House. It would cost $5 trillion over the next decade. It's fiscally reckless—it's just totally reckless.
And, folks, there's so much at stake.
You know, I proposed the strongest border bill ever—the most—most fair and humane immigration reform in decades. It includes a pathway to citizenship for ""Dreamers"" and more.
And by the way—and by the way, I'm proud that my administration announced that Dreamers are finally able to get health care under the Affordable Care Act now.
If the team would just hold a second, I want to tell you—look, there's a reason why we have the most advanced economy in the world today, right now: Because we're not xenophobic. We allow people to come in and work. We grow our economy.
Look at China. China's in a situation where they have more retired than working. They —they don't know what to do about it. Many other countries in the same position.
Meanwhile, in the same Trump TIME interview, he vowed to use the U.S. military—saying this, straight up. He's vowed to use the U.S. military to comb the country and deport 11 million people here in America who are waiting to have their cases determined.
I mean—and he calls—and he calls immigrants—and he means it—he calls them ""rapists"" and ""murderers."" And he said, quote, ""They are not people."" ""They are not people.""
I wonder what would happen when my Irish ancestors were trying to get here, what he would have thought of. Trump says immigrants ""poison the blood of America.""
Folks, just look at the audience. We are a nation that's integrated with all kinds of denominations, all kinds of backgrounds, all kinds of—look, it's not who we are. That's not America.
But, folks, the biggest threat Trump poses is straight to our democracy—literally, not figuratively—our democracy. The same TIME article, he said what I've heard him say other times. He said, ""A lot of people liked it when I said I'd be a dictator on day one.""
Well, there were some MAGA Republicans who probably did like it, but I sure in hell didn't, and I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen.
Folks, when asked if he thought—he was asked if he thought—asked if he thought if violence would occur if he lost. You know what his response was? Straight up. ""It depends.""
He calls the insurrectionists who are now in prison—he calls them ""patriots."" And if reelected, he wants to pardon ""everyone"" of them, he says.
Trump says when he loses again—if he—he says ""if,"" I say ""when""—[laughter]—he loses again, he says there will be a ""bloodbath."" His words. A ""bloodbath."" He means it.
Look, let me ask you a question. Do you see every—all these people vying to become his Vice President? They're being asked will they accept the outcome of the election. They're all afraid to say they would. They're all hedging the bet because they want to be his Vice Presidential nominee.
And, folks, look, the fact is that we're in a position where the MAGA candidates auditioning for Vice President are saying they aren't sure, if they lose, whether they'd accept the outcome. And he says, ""It depends.""
Folks, look, let me close with this. What's at risk in 2024 are our freedoms and our very democracy.
I never thought I'd say that. As a student of history, someone who's been doing this job for a long time, I never, ever thought I would say that.
Look at the Presidential historians—conservative Presidential historians, what they're saying. You find anybody that doesn't take it serious, who knows what they're talking about?
That's why I need you so badly. So let me ask you: Are you with me?
I need your help. And I'm fed up. And I've never—I've never been more—I've never been more optimistic about our future. We just have to remember—we have to remember who we are.
We're the United States of America. We're the only Nation in the world that's come out of every crisis we've gone into stronger than we went in. And there's nothing—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart—there's nothing beyond our capacity when we act together.
So God bless you all, and let's protect these troops. Let's go—[inaudible]. Really. [Inaudible]
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't jump.
Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you all."
